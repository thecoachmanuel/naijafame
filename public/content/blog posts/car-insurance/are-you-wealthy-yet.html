              <td align="left" height="12"><span class="style2">Here's a real simple way to become wealthy.<br> <br>Marty and his wife live at home with their 2 children. They own<br>a 3 bedroom house in a middle class neighborhood and try to live<br>within their means. Marty works full time in the Printing<br>Industry, while his wife is in charge of the home and looking<br>after the children. <br><br>They've accumulated some credit card debt and have 2 years left<br>on a car loan. They try to stay out of debt as much as possible<br>and together they've managed to contribute a total of $32,000 to<br>their own Retirement Fund. It is kept in term deposits receiving<br>5% interest annually. <br><br>Two years prior, the couple bought an older house that they<br>fixed-up and rent out for $850 a month. After paying the<br>mortgage and taxes $300 is left over each month. This goes into<br>their savings account each month. <br><br>At Christmas, the family bought themselves a new computer and<br>decided to start a home-based business. Things started out<br>fairly slowly but after 8 months they were receiving a steady<br>check of $400 a month which also goes into their savings<br>account. This part-time business will continue to grow with the<br>effort they dedicate to it.<br><br>This business also offers them some very lucrative tax savings.<br>By taking advantage of these Tax Strategies they are able to<br>save an additional $300 a month on tax that was normally<br>deducted from Marty's paycheck at work. This monthly income is<br>also added to the couple's savings. <br><br>Marty has just begun writing an E-book about his "production<br>expertise" at work. His plan is to market this book on the<br>internet for profit <br><br>Every Sunday the couple takes a drive to stay familiar with the<br>Real Estate market in their area. They're looking for another<br>property, a "handyman's special" to fix-up and rent out. They<br>have saved enough for a down payment and their credit with the<br>bank is well established. <br><br>The family's total monthly expenses are $2000. Now, here's the<br>question:<br><br>Does Marty's family have Wealth yet?<br><br>To answer this question properly you first have to understand<br>exactly what "wealth" means.You achieve wealth when: *Your<br>Passive Income is the same or greater than your Expenses.* So<br>what does this mean?<br><br>First, what is Passive Income? <br><br>Passive Income is money that you are paid over and over again<br>for work that you only do once. (This excludes using a gun or<br>finding cash on the street) Some examples of this would be<br>royalties for writing a book or a song, commissions that you<br>receive for sales that others make and interest from bank<br>savings or dividends on stocks/options that you own. <br><br>Second, what Expenses are we talking about? This one's a little<br>easier to understand. Expenses are the total amount it takes to<br>run your household and your life. This includes, rent, mortgage<br>payments, car insurance, food, credit card and loan payments,<br>etc……… <br><br>Let's look at Marty's family a little closer…………. Does Marty<br>have any Passive Income? Yes he does. Marty's salary is not<br>considered Passive Income. That's because he has to work 40<br>hours a week just to get the basic amount. If Marty doesn't go<br>to work then he doesn't get paid. His overtime also doesn't<br>count as Passive Income. <br><br>The interest from their Retirement Fund does though. It's paid<br>to him month after month as long as it's left in that account.<br>So, $32,000 at 5% is $1600 a year. Divided by 12 months equals<br>$133 a month in interest. Ok…..what else? <br><br>After the mortgage and expenses are paid with the rent money<br>they receive on their rental property they are left with $300<br>every month. This is Passive Income. Just as long as the tenant<br>stays and pays his monthly rent.<br><br>How bout that $400 from the home-based business and the Tax<br>savings. Is this Passive Income? Well, Marty's wife made sure<br>that she chose a company where she could sign new business<br>accounts and get paid commissions on those accounts over and<br>over again. They've made a 5 year commitment to build this<br>business part-time. So yes, both the $400 and the $300 in Tax<br>Savings would apply as Passive Income. Let's add up Marty's<br>total Passive Income.<br><br>Interest $166.00 Rental Income $300.00 Home Based<br>Business$400.00 Tax Savings $300.00 Total $1166.00 <br><br>Not including Marty's salary from work, his family's Passive<br>Income is $1166.00. Not bad. Every month this amount flows into<br>the family's bank account, regardless of anything else they do. <br><br>We said that Marty's monthly expenses total $2000.00 a month.<br>And we also said………… You have Wealth when: *Your Passive Income<br>is the same or greater than your Expenses.* <br><br>$2000 Expenses subtract $1166 Passive Income = $834 monthly<br>balance needed to have Wealth. <br><br>Marty's Expenses are still more than their Passive Income so<br>they're not wealthy just yet. But they're well over half-way<br>there. With this kind of knowledge a family can know exactly<br>where to focus their financial attention. <br><br>Maybe when Marty writes that ebook he could get some sales and<br>royalties from it. Also the new Real Estate and more work on<br>their Home-based business would certainly help them to attain<br>more Passive Income. Once Marty's Passive Income is more than<br>the family's Expenses then Marty could start to have much more<br>freedom. He may even choose to quit his job and continue<br>developing his Passive Income streams.<br><br>Take a look at your own finances. What are your monthly<br>expenses? Do you have more Passive Income than your Expenses? If<br>you do Congratulations. You're Wealthy!!! If you don't. It's<br>time to get started and start adding Passive Income from other<br>areas as soon as possible.<br><br>When you truly understand this principle, you'll be well on your<br>way to becoming wealthy<br><br><br>

              <td align="left"><span class="style2">If you're getting married overseas, there are a few extra considerations when it comes to looking good. It's time to start planning your 'princess for the day' look! <br><br>Your wedding attire<br>there are two main considerations when planning your outfit for a wedding abroad. You need to find something that you will be comfortable wearing, especially if you're getting married in the sunshine, and you also need to choose something that you can transport relatively easily. <br><br>If the temperature on your wedding day is likely to be very cool, a 'floaty' beach dress probably isn't the perfect choice. Look for something that will suit the environment - more of a traditional ball gown-style wedding gown, for example. Equally, consider accessories such as shoes. Pretty beach sandals aren’t the thing for walking around the castle grounds. Instead consider a high heel shoe.<br><br>What you wear for your wedding is entirely up to you and there are no real dress rules if you are marrying in the grounds of your hotel. However, if you have arranged for a religious service in a chapel or church you will most likely be expected to respect local custom and cover your head and shoulders. Also in some Eastern countries, such as Thailand there is a specific dress code. Your wedding coordinator or the relevant embassy will advise you.<br><br>Transporting and caring for your outfits<br>when you choose your perfect dress, speak to the designer or store about how best to transport it. It may pack well with plenty of tissue paper, or could be better kept in a dress bag. <br><br>Check with your airline for advice on transporting your wedding outfits. Some recommend that they should be boxed or packed into separate suitcases. They will then be placed into the hold. Others suggest that you use suit carriers and, space permitting, they will be hung in the cabin of the aircraft. Outfits can always be carried as hand luggage but this will restrict you to keeping the rest of your hand luggage to a minimum.<br><br>As soon as you arrive at your hotel, unpack your wedding outfits and hang them up. A warm and humid tropical climate should allow creases to fall out naturally. However, your hotel or your wedding coordinator can normally arrange for your outfits to be steamed if necessary. Alternatively, hang clothes in a steam-filled bathroom which will help the creases drop out. <br><br>Hair and beauty<br>Hair and beauty treatments can be arranged when you arrive at your hotel, or you might even decide to book things before you arrive. If your hotel does not have these facilities, ask whether there is somewhere you can visit nearby. For total peace of mind, practice styling your own hair and make-up before setting off.<br><br>You're likely to want to have a healthy tan on your wedding day, but basking in the sun before the wedding isn't a good idea. As well as damaging your skin, you run the risk of looking more like a lobster than a sun-kissed bride. Pace your sunbathing on the run-up to your wedding or help nature along with a good quality fake tan. If you're doing your own fake tan, be sure to practise well in advance.<br><br><br><p> About the Author

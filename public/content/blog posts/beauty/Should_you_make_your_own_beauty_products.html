With the huge range of beauty products on the shelves, why do some people still make their own beauty products?
</p><p>
I started making my own skin care products years ago. I got a book about natural skin care. You can actually make masks out of mashed fruit. They are really messy though, but back then, I was really broke. Could not afford to spend on good skin care so I made do with what I could get. 
</p><p>
I mashed watermelon and put in on my face. My face felt really clean, but there was a bit of a rash after that. I also read that papaya was used in spas for back exfoliating masks. In fact, the enzymes in papayas and pineapples are often used to exfoliate the skin. These can be rather harsh though, so I never tried that on my face.
</p><p>
One thing led to another. I moved on to make my own creams. I went through a period of time where every body lotion I tried from the stores, from the cheap ones to the $20 ones, made my skin itch. That prompted me to make my own body cream.
</p><p>
The cream recipes I found were mainly for cold cream. These were really heavy, oil based stuff. I wanted something lighter. A water based lotion.
</p><p>
A <a href=http://www.womanht.com/beauty/creams.htm>cream</a> is basically droplets of water suspended in oil, kept in that state by an emulsifier. For my creams, I used beeswax as an emulsifier.
</p><p>
I experimented in the kitchen. After plenty of failed experiments. I finally came up with lotion in a texture I simply loved.
</p><p>
A lotion is made of droplets of oil suspended in water, kept together by an emulsifier. I used lecithin for my lotion. Here are some of the <a href=http://www.womanht.com/beauty/lotions.htm>lotions</a> I made.
</p><p>
By varying the water based part, using rosewater or tea instead of plain water, you can make all sorts of lotions. Likewise, you can play around with the oil part of the formula, with various infused oils, or a few drops of different essential oils, to change the lotion or cream. You can make tailor your beauty products to your personal tastes, and needs.
</p><p>
I had lots of fun with that. My skin loved these home made creams when they were fresh.
</p><p>
I even made a batch tailored specially for a cousin, using ingredients that she loves.<br><br></p><p>
Yet, I have since stopped making them.
</p><p>
Why?
</p><p>
Laziness is the main reason. Lack of time is another reason.
</p><p>
So much care must go into making the lotions which don't keep. For me, even if I keep the lotions refrigerated, 2 days after making the lotion, if I use it on my face, my skin breaks out. 3 days later, if I use it on my body, my skin itches.
</p><p>
Preservatives are put in commercial skin care products to prevent these from spoiling. Without preservatives, bacteria, mould and all these nasty things multiply rapidly, spoiling the entire batch, causing nasty reactions on the skin. These home made beauty products don't have preservatives. That meant that I had to make new batches of skincare almost everyday.<br><br></p><p>
Also, care must be taken to ensure all the equipment is sterile so the final product is safe to use. Carelessness could introduce lots of nasty germs into the beauty products you make.
The water and oil component must be heated to the same temperature and drops of one are added to the other while mixing thoroughly or the batch might separate.
</p><p>
It is so much more convenient to buy beauty products from brands that agree with my skin condition, than to make them from scratch. That is what I have been doing lately. Plus the reknown skincare lines are way better than what I can make. I mean, with their R & D budgets, they can afford to do plenty of research on creating the most effective beauty products for virtually any beauty need.
</p><p>
At the end of the day, whether you make your beauty products or buy them off the shelf, it is a matter of your personal preference.<br> About the Author

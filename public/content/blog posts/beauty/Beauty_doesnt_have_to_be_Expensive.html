<p>Where do you buy your beauty supplies?  If you buy them from a department store- you are paying way too much!  I was a department store buyer for many years.  I was hooked on a particular brand, and I thought that the products were only available at the department store.  I was wrong.  With a little bit of time and research, I was able to shave off 50% of my beauty supply bill. Imagine what you could do with the extra money. The process is actually really simple.  All you have to do is find the right websites.

<p>Many of us are hooked on a particular brand of beauty supplies.  We have used them for years, and love the way that they make us look and feel.  The price tag however isn’t very pretty.  Try doing a search online for your favorite beauty products.  You may find that auction sites such as EBay.com have really good deals.  Make sure to find out about shipping and return policies.  I am a sucker for a free shipping deal, so try to find them whenever possible.  You may also be able to purchase the product directly from the manufacturer’s website.  Look for online promotions that will give you discounts on the items you buy most. Coupon sites can give you even better discounts, so shop around.  

<p>If you are feeling adventurous and want to try a new cheaper brand, have no fear.  Most websites will include a list of ingredients for all of their products.  You can then compare this list with products that you have tried before. Look for products that have natural ingredients.  If you can’t produce anything on the label, chances are its not a good deal. There are many companies that focus on creating cheap designer knock-offs, so you may get a fragrance or cologne for much less than the name brand. 

<p>Buying beauty supplies online can be a lot of fun.  You will be amazed at the level of savings, and pleased with the final product.  Try getting together with friends and family members to compare beauty regimens.  You may find a new product or item that you cannot live without. Always remember- beauty doesn’t have to be expensive!

<p>Melanie Breeze, avid online shopper and user of CouponChief, is always shopping around for the best deals.  You can find beauty supply bargains and savings available around the web at CouponChief, all in one location.  Always find an online coupon 1st before making ANY purchase!</p>

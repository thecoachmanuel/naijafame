              <td align="left"><span class="style2"> The Beauty and Simplicity of Life <br><br><br>I just returned from a wonderful weekend with a French family. I realized while I was there that their son seemed so happy,<br> and so well-adjusted, and that the family was very close. <p><br> There were a few things I noticed that they did that were different than many of the families I know, and I think these differences <br> had much to do with the warm connection I felt with that family.<br><br> <p><br><br>First, they didn’t have a TV. Actually ... <br><br><center><br> <br><font color=ff6600><br><br>they had a TV, but they didn’t turn it on even once in 4 days<br></font><br> <br></center><br><br> that I was there, <br>and the little boy kept himself busy playing with his Bionicles (a Lego toy) and his friends in the neighborhood. <br><br> He has an incredible imagination and is very bright! <br><br> I asked his Mom what she did when he got bored and she said, <b>“I want him to get bored! That makes him more creative!” </b> How true!!<br><br> <p><br><br>Secondly,<br><center><br> <br><font color=ff6600><br>they cooked every meal and ate together, at the table, with candles ...<br></font><br> <br></center><br> At every meal! <br><br> The portions were "just right" (I never felt too full) and the taste was exquisite, because we made everything from scratch. <br><br> And healthy? Absolutely. We talked together during meals and shared what we were working on. <br><br> <p><br><br>Somehow, they even found the time to exercise together (or apart). <br><br>One Friday, the Mom and I drove their little boy to school, parked the car, and ran home! <br><br>  <font color=ff6600>Then, so that we could pick him up from school again, we had to run back to the school in the afternoon.</font>  <br><br> <b><font color=ff6600>What a great way to get some exercise! Now that’s what I call a healthy “lifestyle.”</font></b><br><br> <p><br><br>You may think, <b>“Sure, they probably have easy jobs and the Mom doesn’t work, that’s why she can cook all of their meals,”</b> but quite the opposite is true. <br><br><center><br> <br><font color=ff6600><br>The mother is an entrepreneur and the father is involved in a start-up company and is even studying for his Master’s degree in the evenings!<br></font><br> <br><br></center><br><br> They are a busy family, but they make time for one another.<br><br> <p><br><br>It was a truly beautiful experience, and I just wanted to share it with you in the hopes that you might follow their example. <br><center><br> <br><font color=ff6600><br>Try turning off the TV for an entire evening and enjoy a home-cooked meal together. <br><br></font><br> <br></center><br><p><br><br> You’ll be surprised at the level of intimacy it can create for you and your family!<br><br><p><br><br><p> About the Author

<p>It goes without saying that we all want to look our best for the big day. So preparation is the key. Take care of your skin, hair and body in the months leading up to the wedding and you will have a good base to start from.
<p>Starting with body, you want to look slim and happy in your wedding gown not bloated and insecure so watch what you eat in the months coming up to the wedding and exercise regularly. A good tip to prevent bloating as sworn by Hollywood stars before the Oscars are to cut down on carb's the last few weeks before the big day. This should eliminate any unwanted bumps and bulges.
<p>To give your skin that healthy glow desired by all, you need to drink plenty of water, at least 2 liters per day, dehydrated skin looks dull, dry and unattractive. The essential fatty acids found in salmon, tuna, nuts and seeds are essential for beautiful skin and hair, try to eat as much of these as possible. Jennifer Lopez swears by this, she is so well known for her glowing, perfect skin that her perfume was called Glow in reference to her glowing complexion.
<p>Keep your skin in shape with a daily cleansing, toning and moisturizing routine. It’s very important that you are using the right products for your skin type. You can get advice from your local beauty sales counters on the best products out there for you. Remember to exfoliate your skin weekly, this will eliminate old dull skin cells and reveal new fresh skin beneath.
<p>You should have an exfoliating routine for your back, arms and chest or any other part of your skin that will be on show in your dress. This will give a lovely healthy shine to your body. Remember to lash on loads of body cream after you exfoliate to sooth and moisten the skin.
<p>If you are unlucky enough to have dry frizzy hair or you use color and harsh styling products regularly, you need to give your hair regular hair masks to bring the life and shine back to your tresses. Most salons provide hair treatments with lovely essential oil and vitamin products, which are great for your hair and scalp as a lovely weekly or biweekly treat. The price can range from $30 to $80 depending on the salon.
<p>If you are more of a DIY girl why don’t you purchase your own intensive moisturizing hair conditioner and do your own treatment. When you have put the treatment in the hair apply heat to using a hairdryer, then wrap your hair in cling film to keep in the heat, leaving as long as you desire this will prove a more intense treatment allowing the moisture to penetrate the hair cuticle.
<p>Your hair will be shining with health and smelling yummy on the big day.
<p>Now for the real magic “make up” of course. Now that you are all glowing and beautiful nature sometimes needs a little help to give us that Hollywood beauty we all desire. The next step is your make up application. If you are going to get your make up done professionally you should shop around, just be cause they are “professionals” doesn’t mean they are talented.
<p>Make sure you have an idea of what you want to look like on the day, bring bridal photos with make up styles you like and ideas on what hair style you will have also helps.
<p>A clean fresh look always works with definition on the eyes. Make up that looks good in person is usually too little for photographs; the last thing you want is your eye disappearing in the photos. A good idea is to bring an instant camera with you and take photos of the various make up looks you have tried out, between you discuss what you like and don’t like. Remember a photograph is less forgiving than a mirror.
<p>Finally your hair, the range of styles are endless. Do not try out any new hair colors or cuts in the months leading up to the wedding, You don’t want to try something different and trendy and then hate it leaving you no time to grow it out. Stick to what you know suits you. Also going for the most up to date styles isn’t recommended you don’t want to look back on your photos in ten years time explaining to your kids how it was fashonable at the time.
<p>The first decision up or down? Wearing your hair up shows off your neckline and bone structure, always flattering in photographs. On the other hand more people are going for the sexy wavy tresses look that is being sported by Gwyneth Paltrow and Jennifer Aniston on her wedding day, very bohemian chic.
<p>Your wedding gown will ultimately dictate your hairstyle. The rule of thumb is usually sexy wavy tresses equals’ plain simple dress. The simple up style will flatter the more elaborate dress. Either way what you feel comfortable with and the prettiest with is the style for you, a happy comfortable bride is a pretty bride.

              <td align="left"><span class="style2"> Natural beauty is the ideal many people strive to achieve when they purchase make-up, creams, shampoos and other forms of cosmetics. But what really constitutes natural beauty, and how can it be achieved?<br><br>Many consumers, in an attempt to cleanse, tone, moisturize, mattify, shine, colour, enhance and so on, have overloaded their skin and their cabinets with too many needless products. Experts have found that 63 percent of all women complain of having developed 'sensitive skin', and many of these complaints can be traced back to an overcomplicated skin care regimen (Fairley, 2001). In contrast, the needs of human skin are simple. They are cleansing, moisture, nourishment and protection. Skin which suffers from burning, reddening, pimples, rashes and other symptoms similar to these may be caused by or made worse from adverse reactions to the cosmetic products overloading many women's cabinets. Often many of these products claim to alleviate or eliminate the very symptoms they are causing (Begoun, 1991).<br><br>When selecting skin care, it is best to choose a product formulated for your skin type. Everyone's skin is individual and varied, but to assist in product selection, and in understanding what your own skin needs, the following skin types have been generalized.<br><br>Balanced, which is neither oily nor dry, and similar to the skin type of children.<br>Oily<br>Dry<br>Sensitive, which is a condition involving reddening, burning or rashes when a cosmetic is applied.<br>Problem, which is prone to acne and breakouts.<br>Combination, which is most skin, containing oily and dry patches.<br><br>Beautiful skin can be obtained by making good choices for your skin, such as using cosmetic products and make-up which are truly natural. Eating a diet rich in vegetables, fruit, water and healthy oils (such as polyunsaturated fats, essential fatty acids found in flax seed oil, olive oil, etc.) all assist in achieving and maintaining healthy skin. Lastly, adequate rest, sleep and exercise also contribute significantly to beautiful skin.<br><br>Simple Skin Care Steps:<br><br>Gentle cleansing - depending on your skin type or preference, choose a natural soap.<br>Toning - use a toner which is alcohol-free, infused with essential oils<br>Daytime moisturizing - light or rich skin moisturizer<br>Nighttime moisturizing - use facial oils formulated with essential oils<br><br>Make-up:<br><br>Choose make-up which is made with all natural ingredients and colours, regardless of one's age. All faces look fresh and naturally beautiful when colours which reflect the earth's vibrant range of hues are applied. Rainbow-like colours, or deep, dramatic shades cannot be obtained naturally in make-up without synthetically derived colours. These colours rarely look natural, are often trendy and go out of style quickly.<br><br>Great looking skin does not mean flawless, masked skin. Rather, lets reconstruct our notions of what constitutes 'beautiful skin' and 'beautiful faces', because perfection does not exist in the natural world, nor does it exist in human beings. Computers, cameras, lighting and other sophisticated technologies create "flawlessness", to create an ideal image no one can attain. Instead, beautiful skin and natural beauty is skin that is free from harmful chemicals, hydrated from within and on the surface, fed with balanced nutrition and wise food choices, and regulated with reasonable exercise. A positive outlook on life and an optimistic perspective also contribute to natural beauty, inside and out.<br><br>How the organic make-up company Can Help You Achieve Your Own Natural Beauty<br><br>Our products are made fresh for you once we receive your order. We do not stock inventory, so our cosmetics do not require powerful shelf life lengtheners or potent synthetic preservatives. The preservatives we use are natural, such as wheatgerm oil, grapeseed oil, tocopherol acetate (vitamin E) and/or ascorbic acid (vitamin C).<br>While our products do not need refrigeration, our creams, as they contain water, are best stored in a cool, dark place, away from steam, light or unnecessary exposure to the air.<br><br>Our packaging is simple, without fancy and unnecessary labels, boxes or inserts. We believe very strongly that the purchasing power of your money should be directed towards a natural, high quality product, rather than wasted on packaging.<br><br>We invite you to give our natural products a try. We do not make any unrealistic or unscientific claims, such as anti-aging or wrinkle elimination, which are impossible in any cosmetic. We develop our products based on sound scientific principles and the physiology of the skin. Our products will convince you on their own merit, since they are natural, vegan and an excellent alternative to conventional cosmetics and make-up.<br><br>If you have any questions, please contact us at www.organicmakeup.ca.<br><br>Interested in selling our products? Contact us to discuss how we can assist each other to bring our safe, natural cosmetics and make-up to interested consumers. <br><br>References:<br><br>- Begoun, Paula (1991).

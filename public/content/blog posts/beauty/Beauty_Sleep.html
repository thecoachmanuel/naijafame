<p>Beauty Sleep<br>The health and beauty of a good night's sleep</p>

<p><br>by Cathy Gatson<br>Sleeping is a necessity, not a luxury. A good
night's sleep is just as crucial to maintaining wellness as is a
healthy diet and proper exercise. </p>

<p>The Importance of Sleep<br>Sleep is a restorative process.&nbsp; While
we're sleeping, our brain is cycling through the 3 stages of sleep:
light, deep and REM. Sleep restores, rejuvenates and energizes the body
and brain.&nbsp; Our immune systems are recharged, cells grow and repair
themselves, and our bodies conserve energy.</p>

<p>Dangers of Sleep Deprivation<br>Unfortunately, to many sleep is not
valued. In this "open all night" society we now live in, four out of
ten Americans are trading much-needed sleep hours for longer hours at
the office, gym, club and other activities which seem more important or
interesting. What they may not realize is that lack of sleep takes a
toll on our mental and physical well being.&nbsp; Studies performed by the
National Sleep Foundation show that even minimal sleep loss has a
profoundly detrimental impact on mood, cognition, performance,
productivity, communication skills, accident rates and general health.&nbsp;
For optimal functioning throughout the day, the average adult needs
between seven to nine hours sleep a night.&nbsp; According to the NSF, the
American adult population functions on about six and a half hours of
sleep per night. </p>

<p>Don't Sleep?<br>For some, lack of sleep is not a choice, but a
condition. Millions of Americans suffer from insomnia.&nbsp; According to
the NSF, a third of Americans are using over the counter or
prescription sleep aids at night.&nbsp; If you suffer from insomnia, here
are a few tips to help you get some shut eye:<br>&nbsp;Pray before bedtime.
The bible tells us to "Cast your burden upon the Lord. Don't go to bed
with a heavy load. Give it to God. Remember Joy comes in the morning"<br>&nbsp;Avoid caffeinated food and beverages like coffee, teas, soft drinks and chocolate 3 to 4 hours before bedtime. <br>&nbsp;Exercise regularly, but complete your workout at least three hours before bedtime. Keep your body calm.<br>&nbsp;Make sure your mattress is the right one for you. Flip your mattress over periodically. <br>&nbsp;Develop
a bedtime ritual. Taking a warm bath 90 minutes before bedtime will
relax your body and usually make you feel sleepy.<br>&nbsp;Make sure your bedroom is quiet and comfortable. <br>&nbsp;Have a cup of warm milk.<br>&nbsp;Play relaxing music.<br>&nbsp;Go to bed and wake up the same time every day. When your sleep cycle has a regular rhythm you will feel better. </p>

<p>Be a Sleeping Beauty<br>A friend of mine once told me that a woman
should present herself to her husband at bedtime like a present.
Interesting꿺o I polled a few colleagues and found overall most
husbands prefer their wives to be lingerie clad at bedtime. Nude came
in a very close second and pajamas were considered very un-sexy. Wives
preferred their hubbys wear only boxers to bed. Whatever your sleepwear
preference, bedtime is the opportunity to prepare your mind and body
for the rest it deserves. Here are a few more tips to help you sleep
pretty:<br>&nbsp;Always remove your makeup and cleanse your face thoroughly
before bed (Oil of Olay Foaming Face Wash for Sensitive Skin). Going to
bed without washing your face not only leads to mascara-stained sheets
(Andrea Eye Q's eye makeup remover pads $3.50+ voted best by Allure
Magazines 1999) but the dirt picked up during the day can clog pores
and lead to acne. <br>&nbsp;Brush and floss your teeth. <br>&nbsp;Vaseline
works wonders on rough spots while you sleep. Try it on feet, elbows,
and knees and dab a little on your lips too.<br>&nbsp;There
are several night creams on the market now claiming to be more
effective if applied at bedtime, here are a few to try: Lancome -
Primoridale Intense Night Cream $41.50, Murad Perfecting Night Cream
$41.50. If these prices are more than you normally spend then L'Oreal
Age Perfect Night Cream and Oil of Olay ProVital night creams are
available at Wal-Mart and Target. Prices range from $14 - $15.<br>&nbsp;If you wrap your hair in a scarf at bedtime, remember to wash it regularly. <br>&nbsp;Wear your fancy nighties to bed. Don't save them for a special occasion. You are a special occasion. <br>&nbsp;After
your bath or shower ritual slather on a lotion that relaxes you and
helps you fall asleep like Origins Night-a-mins moisture lotion or Calm
to Your Senses Body Souflee.<br>&nbsp;Marilyn Monroe is said to only have
worn Chanel No.5 to bed but if you prefer something a little lighter
then Issey Miyake's L'Eau D'Issey Soothing Night Fragrance is a good
pick.</p>

<p>Here's wishing you brighter days and more restful nights!<br></p>

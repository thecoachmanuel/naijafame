              <td align="left" height="12"><span class="style2">Limestone is a type of sedimentary rock. It is chemically made up of the mineral calcite (calcium carbonate). Limestone is formed by the deposition of calcium carbonate on the floors of water bodies. Limestone is one the most widely known form of sedimentary rocks comprising about 10% of the sedimentary rocks.<br><br> The colour of pure limestone is white or almost white. But you would find that various limestone’s generally exhibit different colours because of the presence of impurities such as clay, sand, organic remains, iron oxides etc. It is more prominent on weathered surfaces. Limestone's are also found in varied forms because of the difference in the way it has been formed. So, you may get limestone’s that are crystalline, elastic, granular or dense.<br>Limestone finds wide-spread application in the construction sector. <br><br>You would find Limestone being used in architecture. Its ready availability and the versatility of the rock that allows it to be easily cut into blocks or more elaborate carvings make it very desirable for architects. It is also very durable and generally remains unaffected by exposure. The flip side is that it is very heavy and that’s why it is practically not possible to use it in tall buildings. Its cost is another detrimental factor. You would find that limestone used in humid climate remains unaffected, but it is very much vulnerable to acids. If a limestone structure is situated at a place where acid rain is frequent, you would find that the limestone undergoes heavy weathering destroying its beauty and shape.<br><br>LIMESTONE MAINTENANCE & CLEANING<br><br>Limestone is one of the most porous natural stones in nature. This high porosity makes it more susceptible to absorption of oils, dirt and grime than other natural stones. You would find it absorbing stains very easily. Most of the times it even absorbs stain from the dye in many grouts. So, before you grout the stone, an appropriate Impregnator must be used as a release. This allows you to have the best possible construction site protection. Application of impregnators doesn’t change the natural look of the stone. What the impregnator does is that it resists grout dye absorption, quickens up the removal of grout residue and during construction it also protects the limestone from stains. <br><br>Liquid poultice can be used to clean the surface. Generally, poultice available in the markets are safe for almost all type of marble floors. You can make use of a Marble Floor Machine, a brush and a wet vacuum to clean up the floor. If the area that you have to clean is very small, you can achieve your purpose with a hand brush otherwise you need an automatic scrubber for larger areas. If you find that your marble gets exposed to oils and greases, you would surely need an added protection. You will find a chemical generally termed as Pre Treat that is applied to the limestone surface after grout removal. The use of this added protector before using impregnator makes the porous surface of the limestone much more resistant to staining materials, especially oils.<br>

              <td align="left"><span class="style2"><b>How to blog to make money from it?</b><br><br>Truly the whole picture of making money blogging is simple:you blog (B), traffic comes to your blog (T), you PREsell to them (P) and finally monetize (M).<br /><br><br>You may ask me "I have blog and peoples are coming. I need to know how to monetize, though not sure about what the PREsell means. So, tell me how to monetize, NOW." Understandable request. But before you rush into monetization, there is something you must take care of, otherwise you'll rush in vain.<br /><br><br>I read some articles talking about "how to monetize or in what way can you make money from your blog." They were OK and nothing was wrong. But most of them were missing one thing, very important one. If you have a lot of traffic, say 10,000 visitors a day, you may need to focus only for how to monetize. And the way of monetization is simple, something like placing banner, affiliate text link, Google Adsense, (listed a few) on your blog page. What you have to realize is that "B--T--P--M" is really STEP-by-STEP. Monetizing will work only when you make a good success in previous three STEPS (B--T--P)<br /><br><br><b>What blog can make money?</b><br><br>The answer is Any Kind! So, the right question should be "what blog can make more money?"<br /><br><br>The answer is Well Prepared Blog! :-) What to prepare? Why not just posting? If you want to just blog and you don't care things to prepare, maybe you're not serious about making money from your blog. Otherwise, please read on.<br /><br><br>First, I want to say this, "DON'T BLOG unless you know what you're going to blog!"<br /><br><br>By this, I don't mean only conclusion of you blog. Before you blog, sit back from your keyboard and take a time to answer following 3 questions:<br /><br><br>1. About what topic am I going to write? Are many people want to know about that topic?<br><br>2. With that topic, what product or link am I gonna introduce?<br><br>3. And how am I gonna do that?<br /><br><br>What do I have in mind about those questions?<br /><br><br> 1. About topic, I'll do a little bit of research before I write. Have you heard about "keyword research"? There are free tools fit for keyword research. Not only for blog but for any kind of writings, if Internet is involved, I do keyword research first. For example, for this article, I took a little bit of time to find what kind of keyword people are using when they want to look for information about how to make money from blog. And I found people are using "make money blogging." This keyword research has two fold benefit. One is that it helps you fine what kind of topic people want to read. The other is that by using these keyword you'll have better chance to be positioned high in search engine result page.<br /><br> 2. About question 2, I'm thinking about what monetization method I'm going to use. Am I going to introduce an affiliate program, a book or place Adsense?<br /><br> 3. The purpose of asking question 3 was to emphasize the word "PREsell". In blogging, though you want to sell something or want your visitor to click links, don't rush it.<br /><br>What do you do if you see a blogger is doing nothing but a sales pitch. You leave him once and for all, don't you? So PREsell is the key of how to write.It is something like creating a worm mind to your suggestion.<br /><br>If you want to make money from your blog, start writing it only after you know what keyword is related your topic and what kind of monetization you can apply. This can make a huge difference.<br /><br>If you want to know about how to do a keyword research, you may want to read this blog, <a href="http://blog-sites.net/blogging-blogging/traffic-to-blog-keyword-research">Traffic to Blog: Keyword Research</a>.<br /><br>To sum up, a blog that can make more money is;<br /><br>1. a blog talking about the topic people want to read and this can be found by keyword research <br /><br>2. a blog that uses the the keyword in the post so that search engine can easily pick up <br /><br>3. a blog that PREsells product by creating warm mood.<br><br><p> About the Author

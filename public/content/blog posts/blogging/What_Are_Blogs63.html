              <td align="left"><span class="style2">What are Blogs? <br><br>Having heard the term previously but not having paid much<br>attention most are just to afraid to show their ignorance<br>and ask the question, what is a blog? Lets face it; the<br>term blog does not conjure pleasant images. <br><br>Blogs are web logs that are updated regularly, usually on a<br>daily basis. They contain information related to a specific<br>topic. In some cases blogs are used as daily diaries about<br>people's personal lives, political views, or even as social<br>commentaries. The truth of the matter is that blogs can be<br>shaped into whatever you, the author, want them to be. <br><br>Where Did Blogs Come From?<br><br>The roots of blogging can be traced back to the mid 1990's.<br>Who the very first blogger actually was is unclear, as the<br>art of blogging did not really take hold until 1999. The<br>original "weblogs" were link-driven sites with personal<br>commentaries. The very first blogs were human guided<br>Internet web tours. While initially thought of as diaries<br>or online journals, blogs have evolved into the latest<br>fresh web content. <br><br>The Future of Blogs<br><br>A buzz word in techie circles, "blogging" is the wave of<br>the future. Whether its a fad, or proves to be a new way to<br>communicate with existing and potential customers it<br>deserves at the very least a cursory look. <br><br>Why is Blogging Helpful to Businesses or Individuals?<br><br>Just as animated .gifs were once cool, blogging is the<br>trendy thing to do. That does not mean that it is not<br>beneficial to businesses. Webmasters struggling to keep<br>fresh, attractive content on their websites to lure<br>visitors back, have found blogs the answer. Content is a<br>necessity for online businesses, both for purposes of being<br>found by search engines but also because it gives visitors<br>a reason to come back. <br><br>Now that we have established that blogs are not only trendy<br>but also beneficial to businesses, its important to<br>understand how they can be used to your advantage. We<br>currently manage and update three blogs on a daily basis.<br>The first is our new business blog at:<br><br>http://www.notepage.net/blog.htm <br><br>This professional business blog allows us the opportunity<br>to tell potential, or existing, customers industry news,<br>updates, or generally how mobile or paging software can be<br>used in specific situations to alleviate problems. The<br>bottom line is we control the content. It's updated daily,<br>which increases the chances that search engines will spider<br>on a regular basis and it helps with page rank because it's<br>been submitted to all the blogging directories. Initially<br>started on a whim we've found it beneficial to report tips,<br>tricks or make visitors aware of new regulations related to<br>the mobile or paging industry. <br><br>The second blog we manage is at:<br><br>http://www.softwaremarketingresource.com/blog.html<br><br>This blog is less formal and contains marketing tips, or<br>promotional advice for software developers or online<br>marketers. We found that we had overflow from our monthly<br>newsletter. Generating a daily blog would require very<br>little effort and would assist us in creating fresh content<br>which our readers told us was of significant interest.<br><br>The third blog is a combination of both styles and contains<br>tips for small businesses. The small business blog is<br>located at:<br><br>http://www.small-business-software.net<br><br>Blogs & Your Business<br><br>The bottom line is you need to determine how a blog will<br>benefit your business, determine a schedule and adhere to<br>it. Let your readers know what to expect and when to expect<br>it. Blogs provide great supplemental content and direct<br>attention to areas of your business that you want to<br>showcase; you direct the content but let your readers guide<br>you.<br><br>Creating a Blog<br><br>There are numerous online tools that can be used to create<br>a blog. We found that because of security concerns, it<br>would just be best to use a standard html program. In our<br>case we used Dreamweaver and create daily posts. It's really<br>not much more complicated than typing an email. The content<br>is then sent via FTP to a web server. If you want to test<br>the waters there are online web-based tools that help you<br>publish to the web instantly. The most popular web-based<br>tool is likely Blogger http://www.blogger.com. <br><br>Other Advantages to Blogs<br><br>While you may initially create a blog for your existing<br>customers, you may find that you can attract new customers<br>by illustrating your expertise in a specific field. There<br>are numerous websites that act as "blog search engines". Be<br>sure to submit your sites to these websites to increase<br>your exposure. This will also help with your page rank and<br>possibly increase the likelihood you will receive decent<br>ranking with Google. You can also create an RSS feed in<br>order to syndicate blog content and gain additional<br>exposure.

Even people who don't own a computer know what blogging is. <br>Everyone is talking about it. Heck, even the Doonesbury comic <br>strip ran a few panels on the subject. Anna Kournikova even has <br>a blog for crying out loud!<br><br>But did you know that there is a secret benefit to blogging <br>that has NOTHING to do with the subject matter? In fact, you <br>could blog on about the sex life of the Tasmanian fruit fly and <br>still reap big rewards.<br><br>Yep, just like nearly everything else on the Internet, there's <br>money to be made with blogging IF you know the secret...<br><br>OK, OK. I'll tell you, but first let's take a quick ride in the <br>wayback machine and see how blogging came to be as popular as <br>it is today.<br><br>Back at the dawn of the World Wide Web, new web sites were a <br>rarity. Geekie guys and girls struggled with the new technology <br>and the launch of a new page, A new web site was practically a <br>media event. In the early days of the Internet, each new page <br>was a cause for celebration.<br><br>In 1992, Tim Berners-Lee, the scientist generally credit with <br>inventing the World Wide Web (and you thought it was Al Gore, <br>I'll bet), created the first What's New page. Later, another <br>Internet legend, Marc Andreesen, put up his own page. Both of <br>these men created hot links to all of the new pages springing <br>up on the net.<br><br>As the World Wide Web came into its own, a new breed of <br>programmer, called a Web Master (because they had mastered the <br>World Wide Web) created their own pages that contained <br>suggestions on cool web sites to visit. Because they didn't <br>list every single new web site, just the ones that they thought <br>were interesting, they were said to have filtered the net. In <br>1998, Jorn Barger, a bit of an odd duck, even by Internet <br>pioneer standards, first used the term 'weblog' to describe his <br>blog called 'Robot Wisdom'.<br><br>As bloggers banded together to form communities, people sought <br>easier and faster ways to create blogs. As a result, automated <br>and easy to use blogging programs such as Blog-In-A-Box were <br>developed so that even a half-dazed wallabie can put up a blog <br>in between munching on stalks of grass.<br><br>But why in the world would you WANT to run a blog if you have <br>an income-generating site?<br><br>Surely your customer isn't interested in reading about your <br>trials and tribulations of the daily business grind, right? <br>Probably not. However, if you can build a blog that catches <br>their attention, such as where the fish are biting if you sell <br>fishing supplies, they WILL come. And so will the surprise that <br>I mentioned earlier.<br><br>You see, among your visitors to your blog will be a software <br>program known as a spider. Not just any spider, mind you, but <br>the granddaddy of all search engine spiders -- the Google <br>spider. You see, Google LOVES to index blogs. Yep, it's true. <br>And that, as soon-to-be inmate Martha would say, is a good <br>thing.<br><br>In a nutshell, Google loves pages that have links to other <br>pages. Blogs link to all kinds of stuff. Google loves pages <br>that are linked FROM other pages. A good blog gets lots of <br>links to it as loyal readers tell everyone they know to put <br>links to their favorite blog on their web site.<br><br>Finally, Google loves fresh content. An active blog's content <br>can change minute by minute, but at least it's almost guaranteed <br>to change daily.<br><br>So, if you can find a decent subject to blog about, and you can <br>get a blog up and running quickly and easily, you just might be <br>amazed at what happens to your site's page rank in a few weeks <br>or more.<br><br>Listen, with tools like Blog-In-A-Box available to get you <br>going, there really is no reason NOT to get blogging!<br><br>Good luck from a couple of fellow bloggers.<br><br>

              <td align="left"><span class="style2">It doesn't matter what kind of web site you have you must<br>understand your target audience and know what it is that<br>they want. Please notice that I used the word want and not<br>the word need. There is a world of difference between wants<br>and needs. For example you might need a means of getting<br>from A to B and almost any vehicle would fulfil that need;<br>but what you really want is a top of the range BMW!<br><br>I write my blog with just one person in mind. In my minds<br>eye I have come to know that person intimately, I understand<br>his goals, his dreams and his aspirations and I know the<br>things that really interests him. He is my ideal reader, he<br>soaks up every word and he clicks every link I include in<br>each blog post.<br><br>Clearly, you can't please all the people all of the time.<br>So, the best strategy is to focus on pleasing the people you<br>can influence. You don't want passive readers, you want<br>people who will take action. Readers who will click a link<br>because you have recommended a new eBook or a new software<br>product. Readers who will click the "Buy Now" button and<br>earn you an affiliate commission.<br><br>So, what do you need to know about your target audience?<br><br>You will get two types of people coming to your site...<br>People with whom you have built up a relationship and who<br>like to read your blog. People who have come to your site<br>for the very first time. You have two jobs to do. You have<br>to keep the first type of people coming back and you have to<br>grab the second type of people's attention, persuade them to<br>stay long enough to engage their interest and to convert<br>them to loyal readers.<br><br>Just think - when you are online what is it that you want to<br>achieve? The majority of people online are looking for<br>something. It's unlikely that they are just surfing in a<br>random fashion, although some people will do that. When<br>online people are usually looking for specific information<br>or seeking the solution to a problem.<br><br>Your job as a blogger is to make that information, and those<br>solutions, available so that they can be found. In other<br>words your content must closely match the wants of your<br>target audience.<br><br>Make sure that your blog has a well defined theme and try to<br>stick to making posts that stay on topic. Keep up to data<br>with the news within the theme of your blog and provide your<br>readers with your opinions on relevant and interesting<br>items. Encourage feedback and always respond to questions<br>from your readers.<br><br>Use a blog script or service that allows the easy addition<br>of RSS feeds so that your blog site has fresh new content as<br>soon as it is available.<br><br>Above all remember that each and every visitor to your site<br>is a real person with feelings and emotions and be prepared<br>to reveal something yourself in your posts. Your readers are<br>much more likely to trust you if you allow them to get to<br>know you.<br><p> About the Author

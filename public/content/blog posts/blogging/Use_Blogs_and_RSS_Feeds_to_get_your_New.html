Everyone is fighting for their right to lead the pack. Cyberspace has its own virtual rendition of this cliché...search engine optimization. Marketers around the globe are struggling to get their products at the top of search engine listings. They go to great lengths to produce material with high keyword density in an attempt to entice robotic spiders to visit their sites. <br><br>Robert was in over his head. He’d posted projects on freelance websites hoping to hire writers to supply him with keyword dense content. This was his fourth attempt. Good writers were worth their weight in gold. The only problem was that he didn’t have much of the gold stuff to throw around. He’d taken a chance, and accepted the bid of someone he knew wasn’t top-quality, but hey, they fit his budget. <br><br>Two weeks later he was still editing and rewriting...and grumbling and growling. Where did these people learn to write anyway? The ring of the telephone interrupted his fuming. It was his long time friend Dave...excited and ready to talk. Dave had discovered the backdoor into search engines...<br><br>Imagine yourself an old-time bank robber appearing at the bank’s back door only to find it wide open and a welcome sign attached. Wow! How much easier can it get? ...no risks, and nothing to keep you from making a quick getaway with lots of cash. RSS feeds and blogs are exactly that...an open door to search engines like Yahoo! They costs you nothing and present a no-risk invitation for quick results!<br><br>Did I mention quick results? We’re talking really quick results! Compare the time and effort Robert invested into getting his site recognized by search engines to what RSS feed and blog users are spending...minutes, yes minutes! Bloggers spend a short time creating a few paragraphs of content that is quickly broadcast around the world with RSS feeds, and get better results than other SEO methods. People everywhere are saying, “WOW! MY site was indexed within hours after I employed RSS feeds!”<br><br>How much time have you wasted in your attempt to increase web traffic to your site? That’s what I thought...too much. I won’t bother to ask how much money you’ve wasted - we’ll try to keep things on a more positive note. You really don’t need to employ an SEO company, or - like Robert - attempt to do it yourself. You can have your site indexed and sending traffic your way today! <br><br>Hang on just a second...before you get started, there are a few secrets to making your blogs and RSS feeds more effective. SHHHH...if you can slip keywords from the news headlines into your daily blog...nod, nod...your blog will be sure make more appearances around the world. Now, go make it happen!<br><br>***************************************************<br>For A Complete Step By Step informational guide on how to blog and use rss feeds Click here> http://www.effective-info.com/RSS-Blogs1.html<br><br>This article is copyright©Craig Desorcy<br>Anyone may use this article as long as this resource box is not removed.<br><br>About Author:<br>Craig Desorcy is an Internet enthusiast who Lives and works in Japan, spending most of his free time on the internet running his blog and websites of interest.<br>Craig(at)effective-info.com<br><br>*****************************************************<br><p> About the Author

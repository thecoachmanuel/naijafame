His name is Hugh Hewitt, and he’s written something worth reading, especially if you’re interested in impact. Allow me to continue.<br><br>Listen to this: “Since HughHewitt.com was launched in early 2002, more than ten million people have visited his site (seven million just since the beginning of 2004). ‘Why does this visitor traffic matter?’ asks Hewitt. ‘People’s attentions are up for grabs. If you depend upon the steady trust of others, suddenly you have an audience waiting to hear from you.’ The race is underway, though, to gain mindspace and to be part of readers’ habits. If your organization has not established itself in blogosphere, now is the time to move ahead, but quickly!” <br><br>I agree. God has provided a powerful weapon in our arsenal of faith. Disseminating words is powerful. And when the words disseminated are wise and informative, they become a mighty gun against the forces of ignorance, prejudice, foolishness, stupidity, immaturity… (Pardon me. I got carried away). Many of you have heard me preach. Some of you have heard me say that the most powerful medium to change the hearts of men has been, and will always be—the written and disseminated word. Why do I say that? Because it is true, and I like speaking truth. I sleep better at night, having spoken truth throughout the daytime. <br><br>The church has gotten it wrong. It isn’t the western televangelist that’s going to win the Muslim to Jesus Christ. A testimony of a Muslim turning to Jesus, written down on a leaflet or pamphlet and disseminate widely will. Don’t get me wrong. There are some good TV evangelists who love God and do a good work for the church; however, the medium of television is too expensive, too impractical to win the world for Jesus. Missionaries on the ground and armed with videos, pamphlets, and medicine will do the “greater works.” (I know I’m opinionated; but at 50 I’ve earned the right. If it’s too much for you, use the delete key that God gave your computer.)<br><br>Mr. Hewitt did a wonderful job telling the story of Martin Luther, the great Reformer, and how his writings—widely disseminated because of the newly invented movable type—changed the world. He did a remarkable feat in sharing his vision of the future for disseminating information around the world via the Blogger. I recommend you read his book today and start blogging tomorrow. <br><br>The Old Testament prophet Daniel spoke of a day when knowledge would increase, explode on the scene as it were. The Apostle Paul spoke of a day when people would run “to and fro” looking for something new. I understand these remarks in a good way. Today is a day that people want good, wholesome, challenging, well researched, information. I believe today is the day for believers everywhere to unit and Blog. Let’s Blog them into the Kingdom of righteousness! <br><br>Remember, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” John 1:1.<br><br>Keep the faith. Stay the course. Jesus is coming soon. But until He does, get the word out!<br><br>Pastor Tdash<br><br><p> About the Author

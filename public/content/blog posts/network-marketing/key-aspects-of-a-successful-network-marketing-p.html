              <td align="left" height="12"><span class="style2">The world of network marketing has many aspects, but promotion, <br>persistence, and patience are three key elements which are <br>vital to achieving successful results in a network marketing<br>program.<br><br><br>PROMOTION is the lifeblood of network marketing.  Whether you <br>are using online methods or offline methods, or a combination of <br>both, you must constantly strive to get your offering in front of <br>a targeted audience.<br><br>There are thousands of published sources that deal with specific <br>methods of network marketing (both online and offline), but the<br>key point to be made here is that you must have an active<br>promotion campaign designed to bring in a steady stream of new<br>prospective downline members.<br><br><br><br>PERSISTENCE is a key element in network marketing success.  <br>You've gotta "just keep on keepin' on", even though frustation<br>levels can be quite high at times.<br><br>After you have been at it a while, and have a downline large <br>enough to provide reasonably accurate statistics, you will <br>probably find that about 95% of your downline members are dormant <br>and do nothing at all.  Its easy to get down in the dumps or take <br>it personally when you encounter so many "do nothing" people.<br><br>Therefore, it is really important work with and actively support <br>the 5% or so that are serious about participating.  And clearly,<br>an active and effective promotion campaign will continue to<br>bring in increasing numbers of potential participants so that<br>while 5% is small on a percentage basis, it can still be a <br>sizeable amount from a pure numbers standpoint.<br><br><br><br>PATIENCE is vital.  You can expect that it will take about a year<br>before the awsome power of geometric growth kicks in.  <br><br>A classic illustration of geometric growth is the frequently used <br>penny-a-day example.<br><br>If you save one penny on the first day, and double it every <br>successive day, (day two you have 2 pennies and day three you have <br>4 pennies, and so on) how much will you have at the end of <br>30 days?  The answer, to the astonishment of many, is $5,368,708!  <br>Amazing, but true.<br><br>Its a sad statistic that most network marketers fail and it is <br>often traceable to the fact that they did not exhibit enough <br>persistence and patience to continue constantly promoting their <br>business for the year or so that is required for success.<br><br>Network marketers that stick with it for a year or more often end <br>up becoming the proverbial "heavy hitters".<br><br>In closing, I would like to encourage you to increase your chances <br>of becoming a successful network marketer by always keeping a <br>clear focus on "the three P's" of Promotion, Persistence, and <br>Patience.<br>

              <td align="left" height="12"><span class="style2"><br>Network marketing or MLM are widely viewed as scams and pyramid<br>schemes. While for many so called oportunities this is true. Don't<br>be too quick to judge true valuable programs that can put money <br>in your pocket and even make your financial dreams come true.<br><br>Many of your freinds and relatives will tell you that these programs don't work and you are wasting your time and money.<br><br>But why wouldn't they - You are excited about the program you are  promoting and talk about it all the time. To a point they are jealous. Misery Loves Company.<br><br>People will always knock you down for trying to better yourself.<br>They want you to stay with them, working everyday 9-5.<br>The possibility of you succeeding frightens them. <br><br>But they worry with good reason. Many MLM or Network marketing programs are indeed scams.<br><br>The important things to look for in a network marketing company are;<br><br>Is there an actual product or service being offered?<br><br>You want a company that offers a tangible product, something real.<br>If the company offers a service,is it a service that people want or need?<br><br>How long has the company been in business?<br><br>Look for staying power. A company that has been around awhile is more than just a MLM program. It is a true business you can <br>grab onto.<br><br>Does the company offer training and guidance?<br><br>Most scams will only offer you ocassional email support and usually try and sell you on the backend.<br>Look for companies that offer both phone and email support.<br>You also want complete online support - audios, videos, downloads and anything else that will help you succeed.<br><br>You want to stay away from companies that are vague in what they are selling and seem more interested in getting you to the sign up page. Or companies that just are going to "teach you to market" <br>without any real product or support system.<br><br>Also, companies that have a system that is too hard for you to understand. How will you succeed if you can't sell it yourself?<br><br>The bottom line is. Don't be to quick to ignore valuable marketing systems. Investigate, ask questions and then go for it. Many people are actually online making full time salaries with these programs.<br>The trick is to find the one that you enjoy and believe in.<br><br>Once you do, you will triumph. I will end this article with a final question.<br><br>If Network Marketing didn't work, why would so many people being doing it successfully?

              <td align="left" height="12"><span class="style2">Almost all of us go to work everyday and do the same routine over and over again. We work so hard until we caught up in the routines for years. With the salary that we earn every day, we try to pay all of our bills. We always expect to get a higher salary, getting promotion or our business running better so we can earn more money. But we do not realize that when we get more income, we also have spent more money on our needs. After we work for two, five, or even ten years we just realize that we have been in the rat race of our financial troubles. <br><br>So, to be financially free is only a dream for us, we don’t think that is possible.  We already set our mind set that we will retire after 40 years of working and then we start to enjoy our life after that. I don’t want to do that. <br><br>What if you can get the financial freedom faster than 40 years? What if I can show you how to get to financial freedom in 5 years? Wouldn’t it be interesting for you?<br><br>There are couples steps to achieve financial freedom. <br><br>First, you have to get the right mind set. Your mind set is what you are. You have heard old saying “You Are What You Think You Are”.  This is true, when you think that you will always be poor then you will always be poor. When you think that you are a loser then you always will be a loser. When you think that you are short, then you always will be short. You see what I mean? Unless you want to change your mind set to the positive way, there is no way that you can get your dream, which is Financially Free. You have to believe in yourself and think that is possible for you to achieve financial freedom. From that kind of mindset, you will get different power in yourself and attitudes that will guide you until you achieve your goal. <br><br>Second, if you do have the right mind set, you have to change the bad habit that you have. If you don’t have the money, don’t spend it! Our society nowadays, has a brand new habit that does not exist centuries ago. We can spend our money before we earn it! That’s right; I am talking about credit card. If possible, cut all the credit cards that are not in used. We will be trap in this financial mouse trap easily with all the credit cards lying around on our tables.  We have to be discipline by only keep one or two credit card that we use often only for emergency. <br><br>If you use your credit card, please do it in your current budget, not your future budget. A lot of people are trapped because they use their credit card based on their ‘future’ budget. <br>For example, Bob just got promoted this week, and his salary will be raised next month. He was so happy about it, and then he spends his future salary with his credit card. This is the mistake that we often do. In short, don’t spend it until you have it in your ‘pocket’.<br><br>Third, don’t put your money in the bank for too long. We often forget that if we put our money in the bank, the value of the money will be decrease so fast. The interest rate that the bank gives is far less than the inflations rate each year. We always have to be smart about our money. The bank doesn’t care about our money; in fact, they made the most profit from our money. <br><br>We have to find the perfect investment. I suggest you to go to your financial advisor ask for their best opinions. They will seek your needs, and they can give you the investments that are suitable to your needs. <br><br>Fourth, if we really want to be financially free, we have to earn a passive income. There are several ways to earn passive income. First we can create our own company that can runs without us. So, in short you can create a system that can works for you. It doesn’t have to be big; you can start it with a small size company, for example a groceries store. The most important from this is that you have to set up a system that works without you.<br><br>Another way to get a passive income is that you can franchise. Franchising nowadays has increasing tremendously in the past few years. This industry gives the owner to adapt a system that are already being established and proven. If you don’t want to build your own system, you can buy a franchise and run it. <br><br>Last but not least, you can always join network marketing. Network marketing is very reasonable for people that don’t have big capital. Opening your own business or franchising a business could cost you a fortune, but network marketing usually cost very little to start. You can always find a good network marketing company and stick with the company for 5 years. There you can learn how to built your network and achieve Financial Freedom.<br><br>Those are couples steps that you can follow to achieve financial freedom. Every journey is start with a small step. So, you can start your own journey to your financial freedom by start it with a small step. Don’t you waste your time, because the time is so precious that we can’t turn back the time.  Hopefully this entire article help you realize that everyone need financial freedom, before you caught up into the routines for years.<br>

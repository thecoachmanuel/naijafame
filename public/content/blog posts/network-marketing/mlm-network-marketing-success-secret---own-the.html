              <td align="left" height="12"><span class="style2">Did I hear you say that these are not your products? These<br>are somebody else's?<br><br>Well, well, they say that there is a thin line dividing <br>success and failure.<br><br>And they also say that it's all in the mindset.<br><br>I strongly believe in these statements. Together they mean <br>that a subtle change in the thinking pattern can transform<br>failure into success.<br><br>Affiliate marketing or MLM network marketing has provided <br>earning opportunity to scores of people. By all indications<br>this form of market promotion is here to stay for a long <br>time.<br><br>When an affiliate tries to sell a product for some one else,<br>why would or why should people believe him? What will <br>project him as a person whom people can trust?<br><br>Many of the affiliate programs give their affiliates web pages with affiliate links. These can be pages for sales, memberships, or simply for information. An affiliate can display these pages by various means. He remains in the background and hopes that these pre-made web pages will attract people to take a desirable action.<br><br>While this approach works in many cases, much better options are available in MLM network marketing or affiliate<br>marketing. <br><br>What I am discussing further is for those who have decided to stay in network or affiliate marketing business for longer term and who wish to make a difference by their own efforts.<br><br>How can an affiliate influence decisions of his prospective customers? By coming out of the background and offering his opinions, reviews or recommendations. He has various means of reaching out to the interested people – articles, own website, press release, advertisements, mailing to opt-in list - to name just a few. <br><br>When the affiliate offers his views or recommendations to others and expects them to act on his call-to-action, it is imperative that he really knows about the product or service he is trying to promote. Just knowing about the product is not sufficient, he should be able to present his case with conviction, feeling and passion. <br><br>This is where “owning” the product comes in. If the affiliate doesn’t like the product, he shouldn’t be selling it in the first place. However, if he has decided to promote and sell the product, he needs to know the product so well that he develops a feeling for it. He can consider buying and using the product himself so that he can narrate his first-hand experience. In any case he should try to sell only those products which he truly approves. It should be as if he “owns” the product with all its merits and demerits and is prepared to vouch for its credibility. <br><br>He should project his views with true feelings and compassion as a result of his owning the product or accepting the product as his own. If he is less than sincere in his approach, it will somehow show thru and people will most likely not listen to him. True conviction can come only when he truly associates himself with what he is trying to sell.<br><br>Even when he puts his heart and soul in his presentation, not many people will believe him in first instance. He will need to develop means (such as a mailing list)  to communicate with interested people repeatedly, gradually building his case and persuading them to buy. All thru this process the sincerity and conviction of the affiliate should be clearly visible.<br><br>This process has additional fallout which in my opinion is more important. The affiliate builds up his image as someone who is an expert in his field and can be trusted. This image will ensure his income in future. His credibility will be his most important asset. <br><br>He will be able to build relationship with his long term customers. This is a gradual process, may take time but creates a solid foundation for future business. <br><br>And it all started with his “owning” and endorsing the product in the first place. This is the real foundation for a successful MLM network marketing business.<br>

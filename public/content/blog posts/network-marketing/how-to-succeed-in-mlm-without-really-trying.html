They use an “inbound” recruiting methodology  <br>2.	They recruit the wrong people<br><br>Let’s take a look at number 1; “inbound” recruiting methodology:<br><br>Most people try to recruit by focusing on the exact wrong information.  The typical approach is to throw enough information at the prospect (company, compensation plan, products etc) that, hopefully the prospect will find something that he likes and join the business.  The problem with this approach is…well…it doesn’t work!  At least not often enough for most people to build a solid business.<br><br>I call this “inbound” methodology because it’s all about trying to recruit people for the sole reason of building YOUR business…it’s about your gain, not theirs.<br><br>I have had countless people try to “recruit” me by trying to impress me with their wonderful company, revolutionary compensation plan or cutting edge product, but no one has yet to ask me a single question about my needs, wants or “don’t-wants.”  No one has asked me any questions that identify weather or not I might be interested in looking at making as change.<br>An outbound process is when we identify true prospects by trying to help those who have an unwanted condition in their lives which could be solved by their participation in our business.<br><br>People will not migrate towards change unless they require change.  So, step number one is to identify the unwanted condition or the needs, wants and “don’t-wants” then offer the prospect the opportunity to explore a solution for THEIR reasons…not yours.  See the difference?<br><br>If you are struggling in MLM, it could be because you are trying to recruit people for the wrong reason, thus, using the exact wrong approach and as a result of all that, recruiting the wrong people.<br><br>This brings us to point number 2; recruiting the wrong people:<br><br>Identify people who have a requirement for change first; people who have expressed through conversation some unwanted condition that might prompt them into action.  Even then, you need to further qualify them as a prospect before your spout off about your company, your products or your awesome compensation plan.<br><br>The people you should be looking for are people who have a specific set of qualities.  The ideal type of people who make the best business building partners are those people who…<br><br>1.	have a desire for change,<br><br>2.	are people oriented type individuals,<br><br>3.	are influential, in as much as they commend respect from the people in their lives and have an impact on the lives of others,<br><br>4.	are involved in service clubs, networking business clubs, or active in the community; they understand the concept of networking as part of a legitimate business model,<br><br>5.	are financially able to invest in their business in order to facilitate growth.<br><br>The more of these characteristics an individual possesses, the more likely they will be to actually succeed in network marketing.  Once you have qualified your prospect using these criteria and determined that they posses enough of these characteristics to be considered a good prospect, only then should we begin the process of trying to help them solve their unwanted condition by inviting them to explore a solution.<br><br>Be an outbound networker, and watch your income grow.<br>

Only a small percentage of these people have actually gone on to achieve enormous amounts of success.  The reason for so many failures is that people simply do not know how to create a home based business or even where to start.<br><br>I am going to share with you the four things that the online Guru’s do not want you to know because if you did, they wouldn’t have a job anymore.  The four areas of focus will be on finding a niche market, building income streams, affiliate programs and networking.<br><br>Finding a niche market is your number one priority when starting a home based business.  This means that you will have to do a little research and find the products or services everyone is looking for.  Contact people already successful with a home business and find out what they are selling and how they started.  When I first started myself, I signed up to money making forums and contacted people already making a living working out of their homes.  I was shocked to find that these people were very helpful and provided me with plenty of valuable resources.<br><br>Once you have found a niche market, go with it and stick with it. Its important not to give up if you fail the first time around, persistence is the key.   Continue to diversify and research other programs that are a match for you.  Do not rely on one program as a main source of income, rather seek out other opportunities and create multiple sources of streaming income.<br><br>Network marketing is a fast growing business online today and an extremely effective way to build a business fast.  Whatever product, program or service you decide to go with, become an expert on the subject matter and build a network with other people that share a common interest.  When you are able to network your business with other business partners, it is possible to quadruple your income in a very short period of time.<br><br>Resell your program, product or service.  There are thousands of affiliates making millions of dollars today simply by reselling their programs online.  Affiliate marketing is a fast growing online business and can be done by virtually anyone.  There are plenty of affiliate programs available online that will offer commissions anywhere from 5% to 75% on each sale.<br><br>Building a home business requires dedication and persistence.  Following these four simple steps will help anyone achieve there goals and the financial freedom they have been looking for.<br>

      <p>Why did you become a network marketer? Most people immediately respond, 
      “for the money!” However, this is not the real reason. </p>
      <p>No one subjects them to the hard work of building a business just for 
      little pieces of paper with the faces of dead presidents. The truth is you 
      work in order to obtain what those little pieces of paper can bring you.
      </p>
      <p>The first thing you need to do is to find the reason WHY you are a 
      network marketer. Is it the freedom to choose whatever you want to do 
      whenever you want to do it? Maybe you are looking for a different 
      lifestyle. If there is one thing that is critical to your network 
      marketing success, this is it. If you don’t have a reason, there is no 
      motivation to succeed. </p>
      <p>A network marketing business is a teaching and coaching business. If 
      you don’t like interaction with other people, a network marketing business 
      probably is not for you. There’s a concept that most network marketers 
      just can’t seem to get a handle on. You do not sponsor “reps,” you sponsor 
      “people!” </p>
      <p>If you have to find a reason why you are building your business, then 
      doesn’t it stand to reason that other people will have to do the same 
      thing? If that’s the case, then why is it that network marketers 
      continually focus on how much money your prospect can earn? </p>
      <p>There’s no way you are going to convince “Joe Sixpack,” to get out of 
      his Lazyboy recliner unless you find out what his motivation is. Most 
      network marketers literally pound in the amount of money Joe can earn. 
      They bombard him with message after message about how “Successful Sam” has 
      just purchased his 10th Porsche, refurnished his 25,000 square foot 
      cottage and promise Joe that he can do the same! </p>
      <p>Just how realistic is this approach? Joe isn’t stupid. He works long, 
      hard hours at his job in order to provide for his family and truly 
      believes that the best thing he can hope for is saving enough money by 
      summer to pay for a camping trip. Then here you come, promising Joe that 
      he can have everything that Sam has and he can have it if he will just 
      sign that piece of paper making you his sponsor! </p>
      <p>You will probably sponsor a few people that way, but if you are in 
      business for the long haul you need to change your approach and do it 
      fast. </p>
      <p>The proper approach is so simple, but in your rush to sponsor another 
      “rep” instead of helping another person, all too often you talk yourself 
      into and straight out of sponsoring the Joes of the world. </p>
      <p>God gave you two ears and one mouth and he did it for a reason. We are 
      supposed to “listen” twice as much as we “speak.” </p>
      <p>Instead of pouncing on Joe with the latest and greatest network 
      marketing program of all time, find out what Joe wants and needs. Ask him 
      questions, lots of questions. In fact, in your first meeting with Joe, 
      don’t even mention your business! Yes, that’s what I said. Don’t even 
      bring it up. Remove yourself from the super duper network marketing 
      persona and spend time making a new friend. </p>
      <p>Follow these recommendations and you are set to grow your business 
      exponentially. </p>

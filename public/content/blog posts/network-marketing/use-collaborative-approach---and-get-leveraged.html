              <td align="left" height="12"><span class="style2">Copyright 2004 Sanjay Johari<br><br>By helping others to grow their business you ensure growth of your own business. I have seen this theory work even while dealing with competitors. This confirms one of the golden rules - you get what you give to others. <br><br>I have been involved in building and running factories to generate profit and credibility - right from constructing foundations for machines and buildings up to the point of developing customers and retaining them. In the process I have had to deal with many agencies - suppliers, customers, consultants, government officials, licensing firms and many others. <br><br>Whenever I negotiate a deal with these agencies, I always have two considerations at the back of my mind. One of them is cost reduction and the other one is the prospect of entering into long-term relationship. It is often possible to resort to arm-twisting to get a deal which appears better for you. But there is a better approach - the collaborative approach. <br><br>Collaborative Approach - Let us take the case of a supplier or a vendor. While it is possible to force a deal in your favor, collaborative approach makes that unnecessary. In this approach you actually work with the vendor as a consultant to help him to reduce his cost of sale, and then get the savings passed on to you. This creates a win-win situation, good relationship develops and long-term source of supply is ensured. <br><br>Similar approach works with customers also. Customers can be helped in growing their business, in solving their technical problems and other issues. This may not give immediate monetary benefit, but there are longer-term advantages. One obvious benefit is that loyal customers are developed. Another equally important benefit is that customers actually advertise for your products. This is a no-cost advertisement endorsed by actual user of your product. <br><br>Network marketing uses a collaborative approach that makes it really appealing. It is unfortunate that network marketing or multi-level marketing is not really considered as respectable as it deserves to be. This may be because many network organizations have disappeared because of faulty systems or un-ethical practices. Many programs did not have any products to sell; their business was only recruiting down line members. Such programs and associated legal issues should be totally avoided. <br><br>PERSISTENCE PAYS - One of the reasons why new affiliates give up too early and too easily is that they were probably lured by some get-rich-quick scheme to join the program which did not materialize as they were led to believe. In any good network marketing program it is important to realize that results will be forthcoming only thru persistence. Building any business which can yield returns sufficient to support a family takes time. <br><br>Good Affiliate Programs - While many organizations have disappeared in thin air, there are also organizations that are growing and growing. Many programs offer unlimited earning potential. It is important to join only good programs with proven track record. New affiliates are often new to the Internet business and join with the hope of making some extra cash working part-time or working from home. They need support from the organizations operating the programs by way of training, sales promotion material, discussion forums etc. Many programs provide such support to their affiliates. <br><br>Personal Guidance - While all these material can help a new affiliate, there is no substitute for personal guidance. Apart from other benefits it can provide, it at least assures the new affiliate that she is being taken care of and is not left alone. This is where collaborative approach comes into play. Generally the person who sponsors the new affiliate works as a guide. The guide has more experience in this field and helps the new affiliate to grow her business. <br><br>Leveraged Earnings - The programs that have a system of providing leveraged earning to its members particularly take advantage of this situation. In leveraged earning, a member earns from the efforts of the down-line members. Suppose you have members in your down-line just below you, and these members have their own down-line members. Like this there are several layers of members below you. Depending upon the program you have joined, you can earn leveraged earning when your down-line members in several layers below you earn their commission.  <br><br>In this situation it will be to your advantage to help other down-line members earn commission for themselves. They are also happy to earn for themselves with your help. This collaborative approach works out a winner for all concerned. <br><br>Apart from monetary benefits, there are other issues involved in the collaborative approach. In my opinion the most important aspect is that the new affiliate does not feel neglected. There are now plenty of free information available in the Internet, most of which can be obtained by visiting websites or thru autoresponders. All the secrets of running successful business are out there. Yet only a few people are able to succeed and earn back their investment. With so much of often-conflicting information people get more confused than educated. If there is a person to guide you it will at least give you a sense of relief. <br><br>There are awards also for those who guide others to realize their dreams. This is the sense of satisfaction they get in helping others and earning their life-long gratitude. Other bonus gift is opportunity of building your credibility and gain trust of your business partners. <br><br>The sense of belonging, which develops in collaborating with others for overall growth of all, is the real beauty of <br>leveraged earning.

              <td align="left" height="12"><span class="style2">Copyright 2005 David Pineda<br><br>My friend Mike said that, 'people fail in mlm, network marketing, internet marketing, or home business opportunities for two main reasons.<br><br>1. Most people start with a shoe string budget, but since they don't know how to effectively advertise and promote their businesses, they run out of money without having the opportunity grow and explode their business.<br><br>2. They pitch their mlm, network marketing, internet marketing, or home business opportunities to their family, friends, and co-workers. Then they run out of people to talk to, and out of money to advertise.' That's a sad scenario.<br><br>The key to not fail in mlm, network marketing, internet marketing, or home business opportunities; is to implement a franchise system with a proven marketing strategy that works.  Sort of like Mc Donald's, the casinos in Las Vegas, movie theaters, and others.<br><br>For intance, do you think Mc Donald's is in the hamburger business? How about Las Vegas' casinos? They advertise, "what happens in Vegas stays in vegas." Movie theaters, Do you think they could stay in business by merely selling admission tickets?<br><br>Let me tell you why Mc Donald's can afford to sell a burger for a $1 dollar. Because it knows that when you buy that extra slice of cheese, fries, and soda, it will make a huge profit margin on them.<br><br>Las Vegas casinos lure you with their entertainment advertising, but they don't tell you that they want you to lose all your money in gambling which is where the real money is made.<br><br>The same with movie theaters, you take your family to watch a movie, and you easily spend $40 bucks in popcorn, sodas, and candies, not including the admission tickets!<br><br>Do you see what is going on here? Do you see the marketing strategy at work? If these businesses did not a have a game plan, they would go out of business or they would have a hard time staying in business.<br><br>The question that must be popping in your mind by now is, what does that have to do with my mlm, network marketing, internet marketing, or home business opportunity? It has a lot to do with it, if not all of it!  The strategy is based on the ABC business model. Once you understand it and apply it to your mlm business, network marketing business,internet marketing business, or home business opportunity__viola! Your business will explode!<br><br>What is this ABC business model, and why is it vital to your, mlm business, network marketing business, internet marketing business, or home business opportunity? Let's just say that part A, part B, and part C, all three parts compliment each other.<br> <br>Part A is the most important of the three parts, yet most people only use part B and C. Especially if you are advertising your business on a shoe string budget! Do you see now why people fail in business?  Can your mlm business, network marketing business, internet marketing business, or home business opportunity survive on parts B and C only? Sure it can, but it will cost you a fortune in advertising, and I guarantee it!<br><br>Part A is designed to help you fund your advertising, and generate prospects for your business.<br><br>Part B is designed to put quick cash in your pocket to pay bills or to invest to further grow your business, and part C is your long-term residual income.<br><br>How does part A help you fund your advertising so you don't run out of money? Simple. Sell a low cost high volume item that is closely related to your mlm business, network marketing business, internet marketing business, or home business opportunity. Something easy to sell whether you are an expert or not. It could be a nutrition product, a service, or an affiliate program, but it has to be closely related to your mlm business, network marketing business, internet marketing business, or home business opportunity. The reason for doing that, is that it is a lot easier to sell $500 dollars in retail products than it is in building a $500 residual income, do you follow?<br><br>Just to give you a perfect example, as a network marketer, would you buy a business that is worth $1,000 to $2,000 dollars without thinking about it,or would you be more inclined to buy an inexpensive book that shows you how to be successfull with that business? If you are like me, you would buy the book and educate yourself first. A book like this would be a retail product that sells easily.<br><br>By implementing Part A which will lead to Part B and then to part C, your mlm business, network marketing business, internet marketing business, or home business opportunity will always be up and running, and no longer worried about running out of advertising funds.<br><br>Part B in mlm business, network marketing business, internet marketing business, or home business opportunities comes in the form of fast start bonuses aka "bread and butter." As you continue to implement part A it will not only fund your advertising campaings, but also will generate endless prospects for your business. Remember, Part A has to be closely related to your main business.<br><br>Do you see now why part A is so vital for your business?<br><br>When you do your advertising, vary your advertising. Do not rely solely on one form of advertising. My wise friend Mario said, "a table can not stand on  one leg, (a conventional table) and neither will your mlm business, network marketing business, internet marketing business, or home business opportunity be able survive on one form of advertising alone.<br><br>Apply this ABC business model in your mlm business, network marketing business, internet marketing business, or home business opportunity and you will never ever have to worry about running out of money,or failing in this industry again.<br>

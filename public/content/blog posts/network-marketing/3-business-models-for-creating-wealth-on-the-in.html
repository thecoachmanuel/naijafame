Everybody knows you CAN get rich using the Internet, but HOW? <br><br>Over the last 8 years, I have researched hundreds of Internet business opportunities... I have purchased dozens of Get-Rich Information packs... I have listened to over 100 audiobooks on how to prosper using the Internet... I've been to countless seminars, some costing as much as $3,400 to attend! And I've tested all the tips, tricks and techniques to find out what works and what doesn't.<br><br>What I discovered was that there are three distinct business models that you can use to create wealth with the Internet. I've used all three to create an income stream of over $1 million dollars per year.<br><br>And I do it all from the comfort of my home... with no employees...<br><br>Would you like to learn how?<br><br>In this article I will give a brief overview of each of the three business models. Then, in upcoming articles I will discuss each model in greater detail along with direct links to resources I have used that are working for me RIGHT NOW! <br><br>*** ONE SECRET That All 3 Models Have In Common ***<br><br>As you learn about all of the models, you will notice one thing that they all have in common. That one thing is called "leverage." <br><br>What is leverage?<br><br>J. Paul Ghetty once said, "I would rather have 1% of the efforts of 100 men than 100% of my own efforts."<br><br>J. Paul understood leverage. Some of the models that I will present will leverage the efforts of hundreds and even thousands of other people to produce an income for you...<br><br>In other business models we'll use computers and technology to create leverage. <br><br>In either case, leverage allows you to earn money while you sleep... while you vacation... while you spend time with your family....<br><br>Leverage is the secret to financial freedom!<br><br>*** Business Model #1 - Network Marketing ***<br><br>Network Marketing, or Multi-Level Marketing (MLM) has bloomed into a multi-billion dollar business. Even with all of this success, we still run into people today that call it a pyramid-scheme....<br><br>Network Marketing allows you to start a business at home that is similiar to a franchise. However, there is no franchise fee of millions of dollars. Instead, you pay a small entry fee, some as low as $35 to become a distributor. However, you get the backing of a major corporation to support you and to help you build your own home business.<br><br>You also get the opportunity to go International with your home business with some network marketing companies reaching into 60 or more countries!<br><br>MLM has come a long way, baby!<br><br>The unique thing about Network Marketing is that your upline is actually motivated to help you succeed. (Unlike a BOSS who doesn't want you to know what he knows - or you'd take his job!) <br><br>I have been (and still am) involved with 3 different network marketing companies... I will tell you about the good, the bad and the ugly in an upcoming article on Network Marketing.<br><br>*** Business Model #2 - Affiliate Programs ***<br><br>Affiliate programs have become very successful over the years. In fact, we started our own affiliate program several years ago, and saw it grow to over 3,000 affiliates in less than a year.<br><br>Basically, affiliate programs are ways that you can promote somebody else's product or service and get paid for it.<br><br>This is usually done by a banner ad, or announcement to a customer or other specialized list.<br><br>If you currently have a high traffic website, you should be participating in at least several different affiliate programs. Nowadays, there are networks of affiliate programs that take the threat of not being paid out of the picture. (It used to be a problem when everyone was running thier own...)<br><br>If you have a lot of time on your hands, and no money at all to get started in Network Marketing, than this is a great option to start out with.<br><br>I will tell you where to find these networks and how to get started in an upcoming article on Affiliate Programs.<br><br><br>*** Business Model #3 - Information Marketing ***<br><br>This is the model I am currently using to build my next million dollars, while my business partner spends his time building our Network Marketing businesses...<br><br>What is Information Marketing?<br><br>Basically it is taking something that you love doing and writing articles, ebooks and even creating teleseminars and live seminars. <br><br>It might sound like a lot of work, but you start small and work your way up. <br><br>I will be showing you how EVERYBODY has at least one special skill or ability that can be turned into an ebook and sold online... Really!<br><br>I recently attended a seminar that cost $3,400 to attend. This 3-day seminar was packed full of hundreds of tips and techniques to build an Information Marketing business.<br><br>I will be passing what I learned onto you through several upcoming articles....<br><br>All of the business models that I have presented have the power to create six and even seven digit incomes in as little as 9 months!<br><br>I will go into *much* greater detail on each of these three business models in upcoming articles on each one. I will also be providing updates of current progress to those of you on my mailing list, so be sure to join!<br><br>God bless...<br>

              <td align="left" height="12"><span class="style2">Copyright 2005 David Pineda<br><br>In his book, "Magnetic Sponsoring," Mike Dillard teaches you, the network marketer, how to apply the proper marketing strategies that will turn you into a magnetic sponsor.<br><br>Though the "Magnetic Sponsoring" book only prints out 49 pages of content, it does not teach network marketers how to advertise their business, it is a guide, not an exact step by step road map. I can compare the Magnetic Sponsoring book to a conversation Neo and Morpheus had concerning a woman known as "The Oracle" in "The Matrix" the movie 1999.<br><br>The dialog went like this:<br><br>"Neo: So is this the same Oracle that made the prophecy?<br><br>Morpheus: Yes. She's very old. She's been with us since the beginning.<br><br>Neo: The beginning?<br><br>Morpheus: Of the resistance.<br><br>Neo: And she knows what, everything?<br><br>Morpheus: She would say she knows enough.<br><br>Neo: And she's never wrong.<br><br>Morpheus: Try not to think of it in terms of right and wrong. She is a guide, Neo. She can help you to find the path.<br><br>Neo: She helped you?<br><br>Morpheus: Yes.<br><br>Neo: What did she tell you?<br><br>Morpheus: That I would find the One. I told you I can only show you the door. You have to walk through it."<br><br>In a book like this, the information has to be generic and serve as a guide designed to help the network marketer to become a magnetic sponsor, but he/she has to "walk through the door" and apply the information contained there in.<br><br>Mike Dillard, once a surgeon recruiter for many hospitals quit his job and became a table waiter in order to pursue his career in network marketing. After discovering the proper use of positioning, and "sellucation" his term for the art of self-selling through education, sponsored 35 personal reps. and grew his organization to over 500 within just months and averaged over $500,000 dollars per year in volume sales.<br><br>Today he spends his time and efforts teaching network marketers the proper strategies of marketing and magnetic sponsoring, as well as serving as a marketing consultant to industry leaders.<br><br>In "Magnetic Sponsoring," I found that the strategy of the ABC business model is the most valuable a networker can learn. Mike doesn't just tell you what Part A, Part B, or Part C is.  He teaches you how to apply that principle in your MLM business,network marketing business, internet marketing business, or what ever you want to call it in order to keep your business running, and to make sure there is constant cash flow, and growth.<br><br>This book truly brings a fresh, high energy, revolutionary, and an effective approach to network marketing. "Sellucation" is intertwined through out the entire course. Educating prospects and applying the franchise business model is essential for network marketers to become magnetic sponsors.<br><br>Though it took me some time to fully understand how to apply magnetic sponsoring marketing techniques into my business, I feel that even people with little or no experience in MLM business, network marketing business, or internet marketing business,should have no problems applying the proper marketing strategies found within the book after reading it a few times.<br><br>In his newsletter, Mike guarantees that in just ten days, he can turn you into a MLM lead & cash generating wiz! I have to confess that at first, I did not really believe that; I thought he was just another guy creating a lot of hype to make a quick buck. After reading his "Magnetic Sponsoring" book however, I really see that he can actually back up his claim.<br><br>One thing I felt Mike could have done to make his book even better, was maybe expanding on the section about franchising a network marketing business with more specific,<br><br>detailed explanations and/or illustrations as to how exactly this strategy should be applied so that the reader learns to apply this technique a lot faster, and effectively to his/her MLM business, network marketing business, or internet marketing business. But then again, the information<br><br>is very generic and it applies to any business. As long as is read carefully a few times, there souldn't be any problem applying those strategies.<br><br>Based on the claims that Mike makes in his free 10-day boot camp training, and in his "Magnetic Sponsoring" book, I could not think of any questions left unanswered, or any unfulfilled promises.<br><br>If you are in MLM business, network marketing business, or internet marketing business, you know that the life blood of any business are leads to generate prospects. In order to accomplish that you have to advertise and/or buy leads. If you are running your business on a shoe string budget, and want to generate prospects, and generate cash to fund your advertising, and do NOT want to spend yourself out of business buying expensive leads, then my highest recommendation is this: On a five star rating, one being the worst and five being the best, I give the "Magnetic Sponsoring" book a four star rating.<br><br>Though Mike Dillard has already produced a follow up ebook with 13 special reports on magnetic sponsoring that he gives as a bonus for acquiring the book, I hope he produces yet another more thorough breakdown of proper network marketing techniques book that teaches how to become extremely magnetic in network marketing.<br>

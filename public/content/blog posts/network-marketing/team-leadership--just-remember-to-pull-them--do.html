              <td align="left" height="12"><span class="style2">By Kirk Bannerman<br><br><br>This article is primarily directed toward people who work at home <br>in a business that happens to involve network marketing.<br><br>I am often contacted by members of my business team with <br>complaints regarding a lack of response or lack of action on the <br>part of their affiliates.  Their complaints typically go <br>something like..."I send out lots of emails to all of them and I <br>very rarely get any response and it seems like very few of them <br>are taking any action.  What am I doing wrong?".<br><br>There are many types of internet-based home businesses where <br>feedback and interaction are quite important and getting an<br>affiliate or business team member to communicate with you is a<br>definite objective.  It's not at all surprising that this can be<br>a challenge when you stop to think that what you are trying to do<br>is initiate a dialog between two complete strangers who have <br>never even seen each other.<br><br>In the case of network marketing, it is of critical importance to <br>build a sense of trust with your team members.  Network marketing <br>is very definitely a relationship business and each relationship  <br>typically starts out with two complete strangers sitting at their <br>respective keyboards. <br><br>The team building aspect of network marketing is of vital <br>importance to the success of each individual member and to the <br>team as a whole.  Two key elements of team building are trust and<br>confidence and these factors play a very large role, particularly<br>for new team members.<br><br>With all that being said, many people love the IDEA of making good<br>money working at home in their own business and expect it to just <br>"happen", but have no willingness to take any action or put forth<br>any effort to make it happen.<br><br>Having been involved with team building and network marketing for<br>some time, I have come to adopt the following as my operating<br>credo..."if you have the desire and are willing to put in the <br>effort, I'll pull you along so you can go faster down the road to <br>success, but if you don't want move on your own, I'm not <br>going to waste my time trying to push you forward". <br><br>Its like working with a length of chain...pulling it along works<br>fine, but trying it push it forward only results in a pile of<br>frustration.<br><br>You need to be able to distinguish between people that have a <br>legitimate interest in developing a home based business and <br>those lost souls that feel that they have just joined another <br>chat group and only want to engage in an endless "debate" about <br>the virtues of whatever business you are promoting, but never <br>actually had any intention of establishing a business...you will <br>have to develop your own method of reading people like this (its <br>mainly a sense of feel...sort of a belly button thing).  <br><br>You can help someone reach for success...but you can't <br>reasonably expect to make them want to be successful.  Its just <br>another variation of that very old and tired cliche...that "you <br>can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink".<br><br>Another way of looking at it is if you are trying to move people<br>forward, you pull them from in front (a leadership position), but<br>if you have to push them it will be from behind (not a position <br>of leadership).<br>

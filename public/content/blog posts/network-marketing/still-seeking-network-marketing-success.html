              <td align="left" height="12"><span class="style2">Network marketing success does come to many people and to many others, it doesn’t. Ultimately it depends on you – how well you focus on your target market, how well you choose your program, and how hard you are willing to work. The following are a set of guidelines that you can consult if you wish to be a network marketing success.<br><br>To start with, put down your goals and plans on paper. You cannot do many things at once, so you need to prioritize.<br><br>Don’t wait for the perfect conditions to prevail, they never might! Begin right away, with whatever resources you have.<br><br>Expect rejections. Don’t get upset by them. Keep in mind that people are not rejecting you, they are rejecting an idea. Instead, build on your successes. Be persistent.<br><br>Treat your network marketing business as a serious, full-time business, and it will soon become one.<br><br>Follow up. It is as important as the initial contact. Many network marketers say that they got their best people after following up three to five times.<br><br>Keep your patience. Expect the hardest work in the first six months and the least compensation. But it will improve. Large incomes don’t happen overnight.<br><br>Contact your upline or the company for suggestions on how to grow your business.<br><br>Ask people what they think honestly of the program. This way you get to hear the objections they might have about your network marketing opportunity, and you can better equip yourself with data, logical argument or other proof to overcome these objections.<br><br>Plan your activity weekly and follow it persistently. Network marketing success almost always depends on how well you can stick to your planning.<br><br>Assist your downline as much as you can. Let them know that you are there with your support. Teach them to do the same to their downline. Help others become successful, and you will become a network marketing success yourself.<br><br>Present yourself and your business in a professional and honest manner. Stick to facts, and don’t exaggerate opportunities.<br><br>Communicate constantly with your downline. Keep close contact with them. Use voice chat, newsletters, meetings, phone calls, email, voice mail, faxes, postcards, etc.<br><br>Read motivational books. Understand the richness of the human intelligence and get prepared to tap your resources. Think positive. Dream big. Keep the people around you motivated constantly. And don’t let the negative attitudes of others influence you.<br><br>Don’t fall into the “perfection paralysis” syndrome. You cannot be perfect all the time. Instead, do your best and move on to the next task at hand. Before you realize it, you will become a network marketing success that others will strive to emulate.<br><br>*You have permission to reprint what you just read.

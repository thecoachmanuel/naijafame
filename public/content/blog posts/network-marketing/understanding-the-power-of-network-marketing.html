              <td align="left" height="12"><span class="style2">Terms such as Network Marketing, 'MLM', and Multi Level Marketing  <br>all refer to the same type of business model.  This industry has <br>had more than it's share of scumbag crooks and con artists that <br>have used and abused the concept.  However, if you do your <br>homework and get involved with a legitimate network marketing <br>organization, this business model has exceptional income <br>potential.<br><br>Network Marketing can produce outstanding results if you know a <br>few simple concepts, the understanding of which is critical to <br>your success.<br><br>Network Marketing, MLM, and Multilevel Marketing are unlike <br>franchises or conventional businesses in that they take advantage <br>of all three of the important, yet misunderstood principles of:<br><br>1) Leverage (of Time and Money) <br>2) Residual Income <br>3) Geometric Growth Through Duplication<br><br>Unfortunately these principles are not well understood by many of <br>the people that undertake network marketing.  And that's just one <br>of many reasons why so many fail at network marketing.  There are <br>lots of other reasons, and it would take volumes to cover them <br>all.  But this is one of the more common ones.  Because if you <br>don't comprehend and believe in these principles, it's impossible <br>to help others fully understand and appreciate them.<br><br>First, lets look at LEVERAGE:<br><br>Every successful person or business takes advantage of leverage.  <br>There are only 24 hours in a day and no matter how talented you <br>are or how much you get paid per hour, if you don't take <br>advantage of leverage you're limited by the number of hours in a <br>day.  As a side note, I have heard of cases where an occasional <br>lawyer was billing more than 24 hours per day...but, I guess <br>that's another story.  By learning to leverage your time, you can <br>also benefit from a percentage of other people's efforts, and <br>dramatically increase your income while creating more free time <br>for yourself.<br><br>The unique and wonderful thing about the Network Marketing <br>business model is that everyone has the same opportunity to <br>become the 'owner' of his or her own business - with a fraction <br>of the investment of time and money of a franchise or traditional <br>business.<br><br>In network marketing the people at the top definitely have a <br>vested interest in helping others on their team succeed.<br><br>Would you rather receive 100% of one person's efforts, or 5% of <br>the efforts of 100 people?<br><br>Obviously 100% of one is always only ONE.  But 5% of 100 is FIVE. <br> <br>Not only will the total result with leverage almost always be <br>amplified, but your income is not dependent on only one person.  <br>If your income is produced by the activities of many, it is much <br>more dependable. Even if something unexpected or negative happens <br>to one or more of those people, it only has a minor effect on the <br>TOTAL production. <br><br>It's great to get paid while you're sleeping or away on vacation.  <br>That's one of the many advantages of leveraging your time. <br><br>Now, lets consider RESIDUAL INCOME:<br><br>When someone mentions residual income many people automatically <br>think of actors or musicians.<br><br>Residual income is recurring income that you continue to receive <br>long after the work you've done to produce it has ended.  There <br>are lots of ways to produce residual income.  However, many <br>people don't understand it, and still others have never thought <br>about or been exposed to it.  <br><br>A very simple example of residual income is interest earned on <br>money in the bank or investments. You continue to receive this <br>income without having to invest any more time to produce it.<br><br>Suppose you had the choice of doing a job and earning $1,000 <br>once, or getting paid $50/month for the rest of your life...which <br>would you choose?  If you chose the $50/month you obviously "get" <br>the concept of residual income.<br><br>Clearly, $50/month will surpass a single payment of $1,000 <br>relatively quickly.  And if it lasts for a few years, or better <br>yet - the rest of your life - it will really be a blessing. <br><br>Residual income is certainly not about "getting rich quickly", <br>even though with the right opportunity it's possible to produce a <br>substantial residual income stream in a relatively short time.<br><br>Most people who fail at network marketing either choose the wrong <br>network organization or just give up too soon and quit because <br>they expect overnight results.  It is important to recognize that <br>the real beauty of residual income is on the back end, not the <br>front, and that once you build it you have the financial security <br>and time flexibility to do just about anything you desire for the <br>rest of your life!<br><br>Last, but not least, lets address GEOMETRIC GROWTH (DUPLICATION):<br><br>The classic illustration of geometric growth is the frequently <br>used penny-a-day example.If you save one penny on the first day, <br>and double it every successive day, (day two you have 2 pennies <br>and day three you have 4 pennies, and so on) how much will you <br>have at the end of 30 days?<br><br>The answer, to the astonishment of many, is $5,368,708!  Amazing, <br>but true.<br><br>That's a simple and dramatic illustration of how networking can <br>work. If I can teach you, I've doubled myself. If we each teach <br>someone else, we've doubled again.  As this duplication or <br>geometric growth process goes on and on, it can produce some <br>amazing results in a relatively short period of time, just like <br>the penny example above.<br><br>So there you have it, understand and apply these three principles<br>1) Leverage (of Time and Money) <br>2) Residual Income <br>3) Geometric Growth Through Duplication<br><br>and, given sufficient time and effort, you should enjoy a <br>successful and financially rewarding network marketing <br>experience.

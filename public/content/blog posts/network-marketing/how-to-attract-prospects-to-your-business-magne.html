              <td align="left" height="12"><span class="style2">Copyright 2005 David Pineda<br><br>A magnet has the properties to attract certain metals, and a magnetic person has the qualities, talents, or skills to attract others in a magnetic like manner.<br><br>In the world of network marketing, how can someone acquire that type of personality, how can someone become a magnetic sponsor, and develop a large base of customers using magnetic like attributes?<br><br>Before I answer that question, read this quote:<br><br>"Nobody who bought a drill actually wanted a drill. They wanted a hole. Therefore, if you want to sell drills, you should advertise information about making holes – NOT information about drills!" - Perry Marshall<br><br>There is a lot of meaning behing this quote, but in a few words it contains the secret to becoming a highly successfull magnetic sponsor.<br><br>Would you rather spend $200 bucks on a drill, or first get free or inexpensive information to learn how to operate that drill properly and effectively? If you are like me, I am sure you would first learn more about how you can make a good hole with this tool before  making that kind of purchase. <br><br>Would you rather buy from a salesperson who insists that his/her drill is the best tool  for what you want to do? I wouldn't. Because I don't like to be sold, and I don't like people to pitch their sales number on me.<br><br>Would you rather buy from a person who gave you free information or inexpensive information on how to properly operate, and get the best  results from that tool, and who did not try to pitch a drill on you?<br><br>Again, if you are like me,  you would buy from a person who first took the time to educate you on how to make that hole proper. In your mind, this person is an expert in his/her field,  he/she knows what he/she  is talking about. So you sell yourself on buying that drill from him/her.<br><br>This is what many network marketers keep doing, they keep pitching their opportunities on their family, friends, relatives, and get all hyped up on the net, on their ads, and every one they encounter. But guess what?  People do not care about your business opportunity, what they care about is a solution to their problems. In other words, you did not buy a business opportunity (drill)  because you wanted one.  You wanted a solution (hole)  for more free time to spend with your family,  be your own boss, earn a living online, or get rich, etc..<br><br>So, what you need to do instead of pitching your opportunity to your prospects, is to sell them inexpensive or give away free information that shows how to solve problems - how to drill that "hole."<br><br>If you can show them how to make that "hole",  your prospects will come to the conclusion on their own without you pounding hard on them that they need a drill from you. Why? Because  you gave them free knowledge  or inexpensive information on how to accomplish their goal, and therefore earning their trust in you.<br><br>This is one of the main principles that will allow you to become magnetic and attract your prospects  to come to you, instead of you chasing after them. <br>

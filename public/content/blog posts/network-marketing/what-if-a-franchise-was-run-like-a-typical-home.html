              <td align="left" height="12"><span class="style2">Have you ever wondered how a Franchise would do if run like a typical home business? This might give you some idea.<br><br>There is something that is long as I live I will never understand. Well I suppose actually there are several things, however right now this is business focused. That something is residual income. I just can’t for the life of me understand how someone can go through life and just continue to work at a job with no plan for residual income. I suppose many people just can’t comprehend that they can have money coming into them while they aren’t working.<br><br>There are a number of ways to get residual income like writing a book, or a song. However, these are tough occupations to succeed at.<br><br>One of the very best ways to have residual income is good home business in Network Marketing. Network marketing has been criticized, poked fun of, ridiculed and worse. But it’s here to stay and it’s popularity is growing. Often called the poor man’s franchise, with the right company, product and timing a person can actually do much better than a franchise without the expense and headaches that so often accompany a franchise.<br><br>Think about this, what would you say is the best most successful stable franchise today? Several come to mind but no one can argue that McDonalds wouldn’t be at or near the top of most lists. So what kind of point am I making here. Simply this, many people argue that home businesses, especially in the area of network marketing don’t work. Well gee whiz if a McDonalds was run the same way the majority of people work their home business the McDonalds would all go out of business.<br><br>Here is how the typical McDonalds would be run if run by the typical unsuccessful home businessperson.<br><br>When it’s open – I stress the word open, (more on this) it would probably be open less than 1 hour a day. The workers would be sitting around pretending to be working, but accomplishing very little. And then suddenly at a whim the store would abruptly close, perhaps to open again in a few days or even a few weeks. No schedule or hours of operation would be posted when the store was going to be open. After reopening after an absence the workers would just be getting back in the groove of working again when a half hour later the store would close because no customers were coming in. It seemed not knowing when the store would be open was keeping them away – imagine that. Well after a month or so of no customers the store is closed with the owner muttering under his breath. “These franchise things just don’t work!” Then he starts telling all his friends, “I tried one of those franchise things once. They just don’t work!”<br><br>This example is easy to see and yet we all wonder why a home business fails when conducted in this same manner. What is great about a home business versus a traditional business is you don’t have to start each day at 8:00, you have a lot of flexibility. However, you don’t have the flexibility not to work for days and weeks at a stretch and engage in poor work habits when you decide to work.<br><br>Of course not all the blame can be put on the new home business person, there are some bad programs out there and timing can be bad with others. Of course wrong expectations can mislead many people into discouragement. What do we mean here. Well look at it this way. Very few people would argue that Microsoft would be a poor stock investment today. However, there are people that hype their particular company that has passed it's growth spurt, that you can get rich and retire with their company. This is the same as a dishonest stock broker pushing Microsoft from the angle of it getting ready to explode in value as they will have double digit growth each month for the next 5 years. Hey in the early 80’s Microsoft had this type of growth, just don't expect the growth to continue forever.<br><br>The point is there are always new Microsoft’s in the Business and Home Business markets. It’s knowing how to find them that is key. They are out there, home businesses that are rock solid and will experience this type of explosive growth over the next 5 years.

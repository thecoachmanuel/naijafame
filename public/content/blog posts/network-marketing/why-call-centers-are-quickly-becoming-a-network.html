This is beginning to change.  The results of those groups who use call centers have been stagering.  Let me explain how call centers can help your network marketing efforts.<br><br>Home-based businesses involving network marketing have some major problems.  The main one is that often times prospects who join have no idea how much work it takes to build a large group of people under them.<br><br>This is a major problem because when people join, they might try it out for a few months and then quickly become overwhelmed and then quit when they don't see the results they were hoping for.  This means that all the time that the network marketer spent in getting that person to join has now been wasted.<br><br>Let me explain what a call center is, and I'll use the Coastal Call Center as an example.  The coastal call center is filled with professionally-trained sales staff, who do 95% of the work for the network marketer.  The coastal call center staff will answer the phone, present the business plan to prospects calling in, do all the follow-up, and eventually close the sale.<br><br>With the coastal call center model, a network marketer's main responsibility is simply to advertise, and get people to call the coastal call center phone number, with a tracking code that identifies which network marketer referred the prospect.<br><br>From the surface it may seem like the only person this benefits from the call center model is the network marketer, since they no longer have to do the grunt work of answering phones, presenting the plan and following up.<br><br>However, there is another often overlooked benefit to this.  It actually helps sales tremendously because prospects are now told that they don't have to do anything except advertise.  Now, advertising and marketing may not be the most appealing idea to the prospect, but it certainly beats having to do everything else along with advertising!<br><br>If your network marketing organization is not using call centers, you may want to consider opening a call center.  Your group will quickly embrace the idea that they no longer have to do all the work themselves, and you will see increased sales as a result!<br>

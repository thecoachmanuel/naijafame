A big mistake! Find a system that works and don't let yourself be distracted. When your income is secure then perhaps you can experiment, but even then it could slow your progress.<br><br>Success for a network marketer starts in the mind. More than any other business you need to have a positive attitude. Remember this key point if nothing else. Believe that you will build a business and you are on your way. If you have doubts they will slowly sabotage your success, and this can be amplified if the only people you associate with don't understand what you are doing.<br><br>This is the reason that traditional networking companies have opportunity meetings and sizzle sessions. So that you associate with like minded individuals who are positive and goal-oriented, and so that their knowledge and belief rubs off on you. If your company is internet based you will find that they have conference calls, forums and chatrooms to keep people motivated and focussed.<br><br>Information about your product and recommended promotional techniques can be discussed, but the most important benefit of these real life, or virtual, meetings is that they help to keep your attitude about your life and business positive.<br><br>A good network marketing company will supply you with a list of recommended books. Some even go so far as to say, "I will not work with you unless you read X, Y, and Z". A good diet of positive and motivational books will build your belief in yourself and your business, and can serve as an alternative or an add-on to your meetings.<br><br>Your own mind is the biggest barrier to success in network marketing, and the influence you allow others to have over it. The development of a great communication system with people in your upline and your team is the key to any networking system. You can distribute flyers, business cards and put up notices, but if you don't connect with other people in your business, and maintain a positive attitude your networking business will stagnate.<br><br>But if you work hard at improving your attitude, and use the above tools to dispel any doubts you may have you will find that your network marketing business will grow by leaps and bounds. As they say, "it's all in the mind"!<br>

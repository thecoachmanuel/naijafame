              <td align="left" height="12"><span class="style2">Do people that are successful in home based businesses share<br>some common characteristics and, if so, what are the primary <br>ones?<br><br>The dictionary defines successful as: <br><br>  *having a favorable outcome, or<br>  *having obtained something desired or intended, or <br>  *having achieved wealth or eminence  <br><br>When applied to a home business, I think the definition of the<br>word successful involves a combination of financial gain, time <br>flexibility, and being able to call your own shots (being your <br>own boss).  The order of importance will vary from person to <br>person.<br><br>I have had the good fortune to be quite successful with <br>home-based internet businesses.  No, that is not completely<br>accurate, I have had success because I have invested a lot of<br>sweat equity in my work at home business activities.<br><br>Having spent many years in the corporate world, I am a firm<br>believer in the team aspect of business and so I naturally<br>gravitated toward network marketing instead of trying to go<br>solo selling products/services and competing with the big players <br>like Yahoo, Amazon and the other well known names.<br><br>After doing considerable research, I found a very well <br>established  and financially solid internet-based company to work <br>with.  Using my business experience in the "offline world" and<br>developing my internet marketing skills on the fly in an OJT <br>(aka: on-the-job-training) format, things have gone very well and<br>I recently spent some time trying to identify some of the primary <br>traits that are common in my most successful team members.<br><br>Whether you're breeding bird dogs, or race horses, or drafting<br>college football players to play in the NFL...it's important to<br>develop "markers" that can be very useful in predicting success.<br>From my offline, traditional, business experience I have known <br>this from the get-go, but for some reason I was slow to learn <br>(or, was it re-learn?) that identifying the people with a high <br>likelihood of success is even more important when developing an <br>online network marketing business that depends upon teamwork.<br><br>Reflecting back on many of the truly successful people I have<br>worked with in network marketing, I made a list of the numerous <br>success factors that emerged when I assessed each person <br>individually.  After compiling the list, three factors seemed to<br>stand out as being the most common success indicators.  In no <br>particular order, these factors were:<br><br> *approaching the business with a long term perspective. It <br>  often takes a long time to become an "overnight success"<br><br> *exhibiting the tenacity of a pit bull<br><br> *being able to ride the emotional roller coaster (two steps<br>  forward and one step back) in the early stages of developing <br>  the business<br><br>Just because a person has these characteristics, it does not<br>ensure success and, on the flip side, a person is not necessarily<br>doomed to failure just because he or she does not possess all<br>three of them.

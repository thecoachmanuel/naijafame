The RISK in using pay per clicks is that you don't know how well that traffic is going to convert before you've paid for it. You can adjust your webpages and your pay per click listing fairly quickly, but today I want to share with you two of my MAJOR free traffic generation methods.<br><br>The most powerful weapon I've used in my marketing arsenal lately is actually... blogging. A blog is simply an on-line diary or weblog. Since they are usually updated frequently, the search engines love them and visit them often.<br><br>The way that I use my blogs is that when I make a post, I include a link to a site or webpage that I want spidered by the search engines. Google actually visits my blogs daily, and takes snapshots of everything there, and follows links from the pages, and takes snapshots of those pages! So, I make minor changes to pages that I want to get ranked higher, and then I "help" Google to find those updated pages. It's a simple, ethical, and very powerful method.<br><br>I'm fairly new at blogging, but I'm quickly getting the hang of it. Most of what I know about blogging I learned from a course by my friend Paul Short. The course is called RSS Exposed. I recommend you get a copy of Paul's course today and set aside 2 hours to digest it. Get it at:<br>http://www.profitautomation.com/app/adtrack.asp?AdID=109478<br><br>Paul is like me... he's very busy, and doesn't have time for fluff. So his course is under 100 pages, and it's all "stuff" that you can read and then immediately implement.<br><br>Does this stuff work thought. My friend Stephen Pierce taught me that NOTHING is more powerful than concrete PROOF. So let's look at how I rank for a few keywords that I'm focusing on right now. I'll show you with a few of the more than 100 niches that I have top 10.... often top 3 rankings for. I know that showing you these examples may attract the attention of potential and existing competitors, so I won't show you the most lucrative ones :-)<br><br>Readers who know me, know that my real online success started with a simple soul food or southern cookbook! That one cookbook still generates a very nice six-figure income! This season of the year, I know that people are on-line searching for holiday recipes and also gift-giving ideas. My logs show me how my market finds me... keywords and sources. They show that for the cookbook, most find my site through Google, with MSN being a distant second. Here's how I ranked for a few cooking related terms (as of November 21st, 2004):<br><br>Soul Food Recipes - #2 out of 1,220,000<br>Soul Food - #3 out of 8,840,000<br>Soul Food Cookbook - #2 out of 273,000<br>Deep Fried Turkey Recipe - #3 out of 257,000<br>Deep Fried Turkey Recipes - #4 out of 302,000<br>Sweet Potato Pie - #2 out of 614,000<br>Sweet Potato Pie Recipe #2 out of 394,000<br>Fried Chicken Recipe - #2 out of 861,000<br>Fried Chicken Recipes - #2 out of 1,160,000<br>Southern Fried Chicken - #2 out of 436,000<br>Deep Fried Turkey - #14 out of 330,000<br>Pound Cake Recipe - #2 out of 547,000<br>Macaroni And Cheese Recipe - #1 out of 207,000<br>Collard Green Recipe - #4 out of 21,200<br>Southern Recipes - # 15 out of 4,970,000<br>... I guess I need to work on that last listing :-)<br><br>One of my other markets is "Internet Marketing," and those looking to start or improve upon an online or home-based business. How do I rank there? Here are a few of the thousands of terms that bring me in free search engine traffic (again based upon my website logs):<br><br>Internet Marketing 101 - # 1 out of 5,550,000<br>Internet Marketing Course - #2 out of 10,600,000<br>Free Internet Marketing Course - #2 out of 11,800,000<br>Free Internet Marketing Lessons - #2 out of 2,810,000<br>Homebased Business - #9 out of 1,930,000<br>Homebased Business Course - #1 out of 522,000<br>Free Homebased Business Course - #1 out of 483,000<br><br>For those of you without your own product, let's see how I do with products I have reprint rights to. One is a web copywriting course by Bob Serling called Power Copywriting For The Internet. When someone is searching for that course they search on very specific terms... but... since their search is so specific, a higher percentage of them will buy when they get to my website. This is a more niche market, but some of my rankings are:<br><br>Internet Copywriter + Bob Serling - #1 out of 985<br>Web Copywriting + Bob Serling - # 7 out of 918<br>Web Copywriting Course + Bob Serling - #5 out of 16,400<br>Power Copywriting For The Internet - #2 out of 128,000<br><br>Another product that I have reprint rights to is an excellent course on how to increase your website, and advertising, conversion rates. It's called, "Small Changes - Big Profits." Here's my ranking on keywords customers have recently used to find (and buy) this product:<br><br>Increase Website Conversion - #6 out of 2,480,000 <br>How to Increase Website Conversion - # 6 our of 2,490,000 <br>Note that when you enter that last phrases, Google tells you that "how to" is a very common phrase and therefore not included in the search. However, notice that Google found an additional 10,000 pages when I gave it that expression. Ok, so I'm confused too :-)<br><br>My second most powerful weapon right now is that I write lots of ezine articles... like this one. Since 1998, I would estimate that I've written over 300. Those articles are a very powerful way of getting one-way links to my site. Those articles are a powerful way for people with specific problems or interest to find my sites.<br><br>Here's a simple example of how powerful articles can be. I know for a fact that the majority of people in network marketing aren't doing that great. I also know why. The proof that I know what they are doing wrong, and how to correct it, is provided by the fact that I was recently the #2 producing representative in a major network marketing company for 2 consecutive months. The only reason I wasn't #2 longer is that I've only been with the company a little over 4 month, and that in my fourth month, I was the #1 top producing rep in the entire company!<br><br>Recognizing what many network marketers are doing wrong... especially those that market over the internet, I wrote an article on the topic. This article targeted those who wanted to know why their network marketing is failing. So if you go to Google and enter...<br><br>"Network Marketing Failing" without the quotation marks, you'll see that the returns for webpages featuring my article take up the entire first page. If a person were to type in the statement "My Network Marketing Is Failing" my page ranks #1 out of 312,000. Do people search on these terms? Not as many as search on more competitive terms, but why not go after easier terms... why not go after "the low-hanging fruit."<br><br>People do visit my sites after reading the hundreds of articles that I've written, and they do make purchases and join my network marketing team. That's proof that writing and properly using articles is a very powerful traffic generation technique. I have lots of resources on how to properly do this inside my private membership site. If you're not a member, you should join today. Inside the site you'll find lots more solid, usable information like you just gotten in this article.<br><br>I've just shared with you two of my most powerful free traffic generation methods. I actually know HUNDREDS but only use a handful. I believe that it's better to get really good at using a few rather than tinkering with (but never mastering) many. You need to do your research and find the techniques that work best for you.<br><br>If you'd like a really comprehensive course on website traffic and sales generation methods, I recommend John Reese's Traffic Secrets Course. Check out John's course to learn a ton of ways to outflank your competition at:<br>http://www.profitautomation.com/app/adtrack.asp?AdID=110203<br>It's 14 DVD's, so realize that it will throw a LOT of information at you. Make sure that you pick just a few techniques he covers, and then put them into immediate action rather than letting the sheer volume of information overwhelm you.<br><br>As I've demonstrated, being a master at generating free, responsive traffic doesn't have to be complicated or even difficult :-)

I know because when I first started my business I did the same thing! After a while I found that this method simply did not work, so after extensive research and experimenting I made a decision to change my thought process from a selling perspective to a teaching and educating perspective.  <br><br>What am I teaching and educating you may ask?  <br><br>I mentor and teach my team and prospects skills such as:<br><br>1.  How to develop time and financial freedom.<br>2.  How to set goals and achieve them.<br>3.  How to successfully be the CEO of their<br>     own business from home.<br>4. How to become a successful business mentor<br>    to others.<br>5. How to easily spread the word about our <br>    company and its products.<br><br>You can see how people would be more responsive to what you have to say when they are not being sold something, but rather they are being shown how they will be mentored and helped in building a successful business.  <br><br>I am going to help you vs. I am going to sell this to you.  Which one would you be more comfortable with?<br><br>“I have the vehicle for the success of hundreds and thousands of people worldwide<br>who are looking for something better.  I have the ability and tools to educate and mentor people to success that they never dreamed possible.”  <br><br>Stop trying to persuade people to join your company, teach them how you will help them succeed with their goals, and by doing so, YOU will be on your way to all of your goals!<br>

              <td align="left" height="12"><span class="style2">Why did you start your own network marketing internet business?<br>Most people immediately respond, “for the money!” However, this<br>is not the real reason. <br><br>No one subjects them to the hard work of building a business<br>just for little pieces of paper with the faces of dead<br>presidents. The truth is you work in order to obtain what those<br>little pieces of paper can bring you. <br><br>The first thing you need to do is to find the reason WHY you are<br>a network marketer. Is it the freedom to choose whatever you<br>want to do whenever you want to do it? Maybe you are looking for<br>a different lifestyle. If there is one thing that is critical to<br>your network marketing internet business success, this is it. If<br>you don’t have a reason, there is no motivation to succeed. <br><br>A network marketing business is a teaching and coaching<br>business. If you don’t like interaction with other people, a<br>network marketing business probably is not for you. There’s a<br>concept that most network marketers just can’t seem to get a<br>handle on. You do not sponsor “reps,” you sponsor “people!” <br><br>If you have to find a reason why you are building your network<br>marketing business, on the internet then doesn’t it stand to<br>reason that other people will have to do the same thing? If<br>that’s the case, then why is it that network marketers<br>continually focus on how much money your prospect can earn? <br><br>There’s no way you are going to convince “Joe Sixpack,” to get<br>out of his Lazyboy recliner unless you find out what his<br>motivation is. Most network marketers literally pound in the<br>amount of money Joe can earn. They bombard him with message<br>after message about how “Successful Sam” has just purchased his<br>10th Porsche, refurnished his 25,000 square foot cottage and<br>promise Joe that he can do the same! <br><br>Just how realistic is this approach? Joe isn’t stupid. He works<br>long, hard hours at his job in order to provide for his family<br>and truly believes that the best thing he can hope for is saving<br>enough money by summer to pay for a camping trip. Then here you<br>come, promising Joe that he can have everything that Sam has and<br>he can have it if he will just sign that piece of paper making<br>you his sponsor! <br><br>You will probably sponsor a few people that way, but if you are<br>in business for the long haul you need to change your approach<br>and do it fast. <br><br>The proper approach is so simple, but in your rush to sponsor<br>another “rep” instead of helping another person, all too often<br>you talk yourself into and straight out of sponsoring the Joes<br>of the world. <br><br>God gave you two ears and one mouth and he did it for a reason.<br>We are supposed to “listen” twice as much as we “speak.” <br><br>Instead of pouncing on Joe with the latest and greatest network<br>marketing program of all time, find out what Joe wants and<br>needs. Ask him questions, lots of questions. In fact, in your<br>first meeting with Joe, don’t even mention your business! Yes,<br>that’s what I said. Don’t even bring it up. Remove yourself from<br>the super duper network marketing persona and spend time making<br>a new friend. <br><br>Follow these recommendations and you are set to grow your<br>network marketing internet business as large as you want.

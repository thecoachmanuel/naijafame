              <td align="left" height="12"><span class="style2">Dear friends, <br><br>If you have read any interior design books/articles, visited<br>a few websites on the internet, you will find the word theme used <br>quite often.<br><br>What exactly is a theme-based design?<br><br>A theme according to me is a collection of various parameters of<br>design of an interior space. So a theme may include a certain set<br>colors, materials, repetition of a certain element, such as<br>a decorative item, etc...<br><br>Primarily there are two basic themes under which a design can<br>be categorized, 1)Oriental 2)Contemporary.<br><br>Oriental Bedroom Design Theme:<br><br>These kind of themes have a still drilled down niche design<br>themes, such as country, rustic, vintage, elegant, etc...<br>One of the major thing about these kind of themes is that much<br>emphasis is given on the natural beauty of any material. <br>These designs are close to nature or are shown to be close to<br>nature.<br><br>These kind of design styles are very rarely found in the urban<br>city interiors. Mostly the countryside homes adopt these kind if<br>themes, to replicate the flora and fauna of the outside environment.<br><br>The designer tries to include the patters seen in nature, such as<br>leaves, flowers, plants. All these natural patterns are seen on<br>wallpaper patterns, decorative lamps, curtains, furniture<br>upholstery, wall paintings, etc...<br><br>Homes which are build on country side such as farm houses, the scarcity<br>of space is not an issue, but this creates another problem as far as <br>designing interiors is concerned.<br><br>A bedroom, no matter of what size it is, requires some basic<br>furniture elements as functional needs, such as a double bed,<br>dressing table, wardrobes, study tables, a book shelf etc..<br><br>It is sometimes possible that because of the large spaces, the<br>bedroom looks empty after the furniture is arranged. At such<br>times "decoration" plays a major role. During ancient years<br>the palaces and castles had such large built spaces, where<br>extensive use of decoration was used in the form of paintings, <br>heavy decorative flooring patterns, carvings, moldings as a <br>decorative architectural elements.<br><br>So in this oriental design trend, decoration of the space using<br>various accessories plays a major role.<br><br>Contemporary design Theme:<br><br>These kind of design themes are very new as compared to the<br>previously mentioned oriental design theme. But how did the <br>designers came along using these kind of designs?<br><br>During the starting years of the 20th century, the "Industrial<br>Revolution" in Europe changed the face of our planet. It<br>was easy to design and manufacture goods on a mass scale<br>with amazing speed and efficiency.<br><br>This created a flood of industries in and around the cities.<br>These cities attracted large amount of people to migrate from<br>rural areas to city centers in search of a living.<br><br>Because of this migratory effect there was a sudden need of<br>housing requirement for the workers. This is where the concept of <br>an "apartment" was introduced. Because of the pressure of demand,<br>a school of thoughts emerged within the architects, who<br>believed that "simplicity" is the need of today's era.<br><br>They thought that, the design of the building has to be simple<br>and easy to build, then only we can compete with the growing<br>demand of housing needs in cities. That's why simple designs with mostly plane and square faces with square or rectangular openings<br>were used. These forms and masses were easy to build and still<br>beautiful. If everything from "safety pins" to "space ships" <br>could be built on a mass scale, why not "buildings".<br><br>The school of thought believed that a plane rectangular form<br>is in itself beautiful and they proved this using infinite<br>permutations and combinations of the basic square form. That's<br>why decoration was given a second preference. Today we call this<br>school of thought as "contemporary". In contemporary design<br>every element has an order.<br><br>That's why in today's modern interior design, simplicity is the<br>key to an efficient design. Unlike the previous oriental design<br>theme, the contemporary design theme states that any kind of <br>architectural decoration is always dependent on the basic form <br>of the building. The form itself is so beautiful, that the need<br>to further decorate it is not required. Today's modern interiors<br>spaces are simple to understand, simple to construct, and<br>project a kind of simplicity.<br><br>By reading the above paragraphs some of you might say that,<br>decoration is no more needed. But this is not true. I am not trying<br>to force some ideas here. But most people confuse the whole<br>concept of "Interior Design" and "Interior Decoration". Both<br>are quite different and both have a unique value in today's <br>complex society.<br><br>Decoration was something the primitive man learned, looking at<br>the nature around him. He saw plants, flowers, birds, animals<br>and tried to copy these elements. We still use "embroidery" on<br>our dresses. But the modern design theory says that any sort<br>of decoration can only "enhance" the existing form, but can not <br>be an element of design. <br><br>What does this mean?<br><br>In the above said example the "embroidery" pattern can certainly<br>add to the beauty of the cloth, but the modern theory denies to<br>accept the cloth to be of a cheap quality. It states that every form, texture, material, shape is in itself beautiful and must be<br>accepted as it is. Because of this the need to further decorate it<br>does not arise.<br><br>Thus decoration whether used in architecture or elsewhere is always<br>dependant on the form on which it is used, but design is<br>an independent entity which does not need any justification from the<br>external factors.<br><br>The two design themes mentioned above are still widely used today.<br>The user must look upon them from a point of view of what best suits<br>his/her likes and dislikes. Only then can you give yourself and<br>your family the best quality of living.<br><br>I hope this article was informative to everyone.<br><br>Copyright Shrinivas Vaidya

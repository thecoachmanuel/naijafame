              <td align="left" height="12"><span class="style2"> starts with you. That’s a statement that you will have to remember throughout your search for your dream home. The reason is because throughout your journey of finding your dream home, you will find yourself being derailed one time too many. Everyone will want to give you advice on where is the best location, who’s the better realtor, who is better contractor, etc. so, remember, it’s YOUR dream home. When in doubt, refer to yourself. Better yet, browse through magazines and newspapers and cut out pictures of homes that you like, areas that you fancy and paste it into a special ‘My dream home project’ book. This way, you can’t go wrong.<br><br>The first thing to do is to determine the area where you want to get a house in. Your dream home should not be too far away from your work place, schools, family members, etc…unless you want it to be, of course. Get a real estate agent to help you buy the house off the original owner. Some websites actually allow you to key in an area code and they will give you a whole list of houses on sale in that area. If your dream house is listed, you’re in luck. They will assign a realtor to work with you on buying your dream home.<br><br>The next step towards buying your dream home is, of course, financing. If you have the cash, you can buy your dream home instantly. Nobody rejects cash! Well, unless the original owner wishes to keep the home because of sentimental reasons. If you’re like the rest of us, you may not have enough money to buy your dream home in cash. So, start researching on an affordable and most viable home loan.<br><br>The process between signing the agreement to getting the loan to having the keys to your dream home is a long way. This is a good time for you to find a contractor to design and construct your dream home for you. The best way to find a suitable contractor to design your dream home is to ask around – there’s nothing quite like referrals. Referrals mean they are satisfied with the services that have been provided by the contractor.<br><br>Designing and constructing your dream home is both a painful and pleasurable experience! I mean, you’re literally designing a home that you hope to live in for a couple of years, maybe even for a lifetime! It’s exciting as you watch every single inch of the house transform from an empty hollow shell into the home of your dreams! The artistic input from the designer, your own personal preferences all combine together – and viola! You have a dream home to live in.<br><br>This is also the time to discuss the inside of your home – would you like it to be cozy or clean and organized? Is there any particular style preference you think you should tell your designer/contractor? Your dream home should be consistent in all areas of the home – but they can have different characteristics. For example, exotic Asian look for the bedroom, French home look in the kitchen and the fun, jovial and cheery look for the kids’ bedrooms.<br><br>The most important thing to consider is the comfort level and practicality of your dream home. <br><br>Dakota Caudilla, journalist, and website builder Dakota Caudilla lives in Texas.

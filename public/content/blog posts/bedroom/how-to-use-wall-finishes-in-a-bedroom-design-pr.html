              <td align="left" height="12"><span class="style2">Dear friends, any interior space is composed of some primary<br>architectural elements such as walls, floor and ceiling.<br>Depending upon the type of structural framework, the <br>construction method would change.<br><br>We always see experience and perceive any interior space<br>in elevation. This means that walls are the first things of<br>any structure that create an impact on our mind. The quality<br>and volume formed because of the walls define an architectural<br>structure.<br><br>When we enter a building, what we primarily and dominantly <br>perceive are walls. Let's see how walls can be used as an <br>excellent element in a bedroom design project.<br><br>1) Exposed Brick walls.<br><br>In order to use these kind of walls it is necessary to preplan the <br>interior design schedule. Normally if a brick wall is to<br>be kept exposed (without plaster), it is built with high quality<br>bricks which are machine cut for high quality and accuracy.<br><br>Since bricks have their own color and texture, this option can<br>be used to create a color contrast by keeping only one wall<br>exposed and other with a contrasting color. This can add some<br>interest in the bedroom.<br><br>2) Exposed plaster walls.<br><br>An exposed plaster wall is a wall which has not been painted.<br><br>These kind of walls are very rarely used in interiors. Since<br>the plaster is a composite material using appropriate qualities<br>of cement, sand and aggregate, the final material has a dull<br>color. A dull color on a space like bedroom would express<br>a kind of depression, hence is not recommended.<br><br>But portions of a wall with preplanned design and sketching can<br>be used in association with exposed brick wall. Design<br>pattern with partly colored and partly exposed plaster can be a <br>good idea.<br><br>Or a completely exposed plaster wall with a design patter in grooves <br>can be used effectively.<br><br>3) Wall with tile cladding.<br><br>Tile cladding is what we see in kitchen above the cooking <br>platform. Tile cladding is also used in bathrooms and toilets.<br>These are normally ceramic tiles.<br><br>In a bedroom interesting patterns can be created to fake the<br>exposed brick wall mentioned above. Many excellent patters<br>can be used just like a jigsaw puzzle.<br><br>4) Paint on walls.<br><br>The word painting has two meanings here.<br><br>a) A wall with plane colors applied to it. This is done above the <br>plastered surface of the wall. Two or three coats of the desired<br>shade of the color and base material are applied.<br><br>b)Secondly, instead of using plane colors, the entire wall can<br>be used as a "canvas"  to paint a story or mural. This is a very<br>good method to paint children bedrooms. Walls can be used as a<br>storyboard to create interest.<br><br>5) Wallpapers.<br><br>Applying a wallpaper is an excellent way to quickly change the <br>look and feel of the bedroom. Depending upon the "theme" of the room<br>many wallpaper patterns are available.<br><br>Wallpapers are very good in large bedrooms. In large bedroom<br>"emptiness" is a big problem. If there are not enough decorating <br>elements available, a room might look empty. Here wallpapers can<br>serve as fillers and quickly add some interest in the room.<br><br>6)Textured plaster walls.<br><br>These kind of walls need special techniques to create a textured<br>pattern on walls. Once a texture is applied any shade of<br>paint can be used.<br><br>One of the great thing about these walls is, when sunlight falls on <br>them, a very interesting play of light and shadows gets created.<br>Because of the undulations in the surface of the plaster, small<br>shadows form on the surface of the wall, giving it a visual<br>quality.<br><br>A wall in the bedroom which receives direct sunlight should be<br>chosen for this purpose.<br><br>This article shows you how various options to the existing wall<br>finishes are possible, that can enhance the quality of the<br>bedroom interior space.<br><br>I hope this article was informative to everyone.<br><br>Copyright Shrinivas Vaidya

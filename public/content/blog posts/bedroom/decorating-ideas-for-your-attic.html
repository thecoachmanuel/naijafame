              <td align="left" height="12"><span class="style2">Do you have an attic in your house? Lucky You! You can decorate your attic however you like and create your own favorite corner in the house, or even an extra place for your children or your guests. Depending on your attics’ space and on your own personal taste, you can finally have an attic that fulfils your needs.<br>	Need an extra bedroom? The attic can turn into a beautiful private bedroom for a friend that stays the night, a visiting couple, or a relative from out of town. Use light shades and soft fabric materials; you don’t want your guest to get tired and dizzy from the lively colors. Instead, create a pleasant, romantic atmosphere. You will need a single or, if there is enough space, a double bed, a small closet with drawers and one or two small bedside tables. A big, elegantly shaped mirror will add several points and will make the room seem spacious. If the room is already spacious enough, you can place a bedroom chair facing the window. Add a dreamcatcher or a wind chime and enjoy the results!<br>	How about a playroom for your children? They would love to have their own, “No Moms Allowed!” space for their toys, their games and their imagination. You will need a soft, warm carpet to keep the room cozy during wintertime. Don’t carpet the corners though, as you will need some room to swap out for a lighter, cooler carpet for the summer days. You will also need large pillows or soft inflatable chairs. When opting for a playroom, use lively colors that will keep the children excited and happy. This room could have a small TV and DVD play set, videogames, board games, many toys, and puzzles, whatever a kid needs! Don’t place sporting material such as bouncers, trampolines and swings because the roof is too low in attics and the children might get hurt while playing. <br>	Are you an artist? Even if the answer is no, an attic can make you one! Make your own inspirational studio. Don’t use a carpet this time. Color and material chips will stain it. If you are a painter, equip your studio with painting knives, palettes, art pencils, drawing sticks, charcoal, paints, brushes and canvas, paper blocks and rolls. If you are a craftsman you can create a wood art studio. Equip it with a large working table, hole cutting templates, curving tools. Place furniture with shelves in the corner to place and admire your artwork.<br>	An attic can be your gym! You’ll need adequate ventilation in there, or a large window. Dress the room with a soft carpet and buy your gym equipment. Don’t buy large fitness equipment. Prefer many smaller ones, or a few multi training machines. You can also have light exercise tools like fitness balls, tummy trimmers, weight sets, yoga mats. A small refrigerator filled with bottled water or energy drinks is necessary for the attic gym room so that you won’t need to run downstairs every time you get thirsty. A mini stereo will enhance your exercise with power music. <br>	There is no limit to your imagination about the potential use of your attic space. Sure, it comes in handy as a storage place, but what moments of joy can you invest in a storage place? With creativity and a little money, the attic can be your favorite room.

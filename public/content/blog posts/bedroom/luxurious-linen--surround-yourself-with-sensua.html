              <td align="left" height="12"><span class="style2">Luxury linen has been used for centuries. Writers speak in poetic terms of the lovely sensual textures and styles of sheets that were once decadent and even sinful because they were so lush and beautiful. Luxury linens were so revered that one of the most important heirlooms a mother could give a daughter on her wedding day was linen that had been passed from one to another. Quality linen was the tie that bound the generations together.  Most bedding and sheets were actually made of linen and not the cotton or blends we use today. This could only have been achieved because linen is so durable and beautiful that time will enhance its beauty. <br>I have linen from my grandmother that is still in excellent shape today.  If linen is well cared for especially in a cedar chest it will remain unstained and beautiful for years. Weavers that work with fine linen have a magic that is appreciated by discerning customers. A continuous weave with no seams is desirable and organic flax linen shows true luxury in a traditional sense.  The color of linen is natural and this is the true color that most want in their fine bed linen.  One of the most luxurious duvet covers I have ever seen was made of linen. Linen is elegant, beautiful, durable and a very refined fabric today. It is the strongest of natural fibers; having 2 to 3 times the strength of cotton. The natural luster comes from the wax in the flax plant. Highly absorbent and a good conductor of heat, this fabric is cool in garments. However, constant creasing in the same place in sharp folds will tend to break the linen threads. This wear can show up in collars, hems, and any area that is iron creased during the laundering. Linen has poor elasticity and does not spring back readily. This fabric is smooth and can be very lint free. Picture yourself at a fine dinner with all of your best china and the smooth linen napkins and tablecloths beside it. Nothing quite enhances the beauty of china besides linen.<br>If linen is not to your liking; you can shop online or any one of your favorite stores and find luxurious bedding in comforters, bedspreads, duvet covers, sheets and more in high thread count cotton. Egyptian cotton is desired because the fibers are long and lofty making for soft bedding. I love bed linen that is cool and crisp with sharp edging for a well made bed. It’s great in the summer to sleep on natural fibers because sheets that are made of a polyester blend can be warmer. If you want warmer, save the polyester for flannel sheets in the winter. Go to http://www.bedding-4u.com for the most in bedding. <br><br> If you want to change up your decorating theme in a bedroom quickly, just purchase a new duvet cover. Luxurious comforters and duvets can change a bedroom into something out of a magazine without spending a fortune. If you make just that one change, you will be surprised at the difference. Don’t limit yourself to cheap bedding just because you think you can’t afford a complete suite. If you shop at the clearance table, you can find a piece here and a piece there to add to the bedding mix. You can make a unique statement out of fine linen at a price you can afford.<br><br>

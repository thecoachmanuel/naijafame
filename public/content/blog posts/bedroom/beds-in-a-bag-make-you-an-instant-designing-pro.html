Everything you need comes in one complete set, and is designed to match or coordinate perfectly.<br><br>With no guess work, your bedroom will come out looking just like those in the finest home design magazines and at a price you can afford.<br><br>If you stick with the better designer brands names like Lawrence, Burlington House, Dan River, and Croscill you'll find the attention to detail, fabrics and quality to be superior. <br><br>They'll typically feature higher thread counts of 200 or more, which will provide the best combination of luxury and durability.<br><br>Another example would be a simple matter of the elastic that comes on fitted sheets. The better ones will have elastic all the way around the edges, not just on two sides. This insures that your sheet won't pop off the corner of the bed while you're sleeping. I personally hate waking up tangled-up like that! lol<br><br>To be sure what's included in your bed bag, check your descriptive list carefully.<br>Most of the basics in bed bag sets will include:<br>comforter, flat and fitted sheets, bed skirt, pillowcase (s)<br><br>Many of the better sets will also offer optional matching drapes, area rugs, accent tables, lamps and other important accessories like accent pillows. You'll be amazed at how much detail and flair a few of these lush little decorative pillows can add to your bedroom! <br><br>You'll be able to select a complete ensemble that will deck out your entire bedroom from floor to ceiling with matching accessories. <br><br>You'll know these sets will match your taste to a Capital-"T", whether that means Traditional, Tasteful or Trendy!<br><br>Bedding in a bag sets are affordable and often cost much less than purchasing the items ala carte. The best part is you know that even the wildest, boldest colors, prints, patterns and fabrics for your bedding and accessories, will be designed to match and coordinate just perfectly. Get that home design magazine look the easy way!<br><br>If you're like many and simply insist on 5 or 6 pillow cases, you won't find that many in most bed bags. Don't worry. You can add coordinating solid pillow cases easily enough. Maybe with piping and extra detailing that matches the overall color scheme. Some of the best bed bag sets will actually have optional matching pillow cases available.<br><br>Let's look at just two popular, quality bedding sets. There are hundreds of bed bag sets to select from, so let your creative juices flow!<br><br>Dan River always designs quality bedding whether you choose separate items or bed in a bags. The Monument Springs set is one example. Using earth tones to create a natural look, this set features a faux suede comforter in tan, brown, beige and chocolate with a large patchwork look.<br> <br>Nothing's quilt-like about these large patches of near-suede material, they look and feel like the real thing...but without the problems of cowhide which feels so heavy and will become shiny with use. This suede-like fabric will last for years and has a light-weight feel and soft, cuddly texture. <br>Solid light neutral tone sheets and pillow shams in 210 thread count provide lasting night time comfort. A 100% polyester bed skirt in a solid brown earth tone completes this set to perfection. Of course, you'll want to dry clean the comforter and bed skirt. <br>The sheets and pillow shams are machine washable. Beautiful enough for the most elegant bedroom, this easy to love bag bed set is just unique and easy to live in.<br><br>Burlington House Luxury Bed in a Bag Set in their Tuscany design is a fabulous set in shades of greens and ivory. The set includes 220 thread count cotton sheets and pillowcases. <br><br>The top sheet is edged in a beautiful, small floral pattern which creates the perfect accent. It's got a center of ivory highlighted with the small floral pattern around the edges which matches the flat sheet perfectly. <br>The drop section of the comforter is olive green and the color scheme is perfect for blending into a room featuring natural, earth colors. The comforter needs to be dry cleaned along with the bed skirt. The sheets and pillow cases are machine washable. <br><br>Complete your look with the matching drapes, area rugs, tables, lamps and various shaped decorative accent pillows, and you'll be proud and amazed at how easy it was to pull your bedroom decor together!<br><br>You'll love having fun selecting the different bedroom looks you can create from bedding in a bag sets like this. You could even switch themes from bright, cheery florals for spring and summer, to more traditional tones for fall and winter- why keep the same look all year round..?<br><br>No one but you will know that you didn't call in a professional home designer to help you decorate the perfect bedroom. You'll love the selection of fabrics, the textures, colors and patterns- and the coordinated look you'll get when you choose top quality bedding that comes in sets like this.

              <td align="left" height="12"><span class="style2">Any interior space is primarily composed of walls, floor and<br>ceiling. These elements give a habitable character to the<br>interior space. <br><br>Apart from providing protection from natural elements such as<br>rain, snow, wind and other natural calamities, an interior<br>space is also responsible for creating moods, depending upon the<br>theme of the decoration. <br><br>Depending upon the functional purpose of the interior space, the<br>quality and quantity of the furniture and other elements may<br>change. For example a "meditation center" might not require<br>any furniture at all, but a gymnasium on the other hand requires<br>specially designed equipment.<br><br>For the sake of this article we are only going to concentrate on<br>bedrooms. A bedroom is a space, which is close to our heart. This<br>is the space where we take rest and regain the vital energy<br>force for the next day's work. A typical bedroom consists of<br>a double/single bed depending upon the size and occupancy of the<br>room, wardrobe, study table, chairs for informal gathering, <br>dressing table, side tables adjacent to the bed for keeping<br>items such as telephone, watch, etc..<br><br>Since a bulk of volume gets occupied with the furniture pieces,<br>the beauty of a bedroom greatly depends upon the quality of the<br>furniture. But that's not all. Any interior space can be greatly enhanced using "accessories" and some great amount of detailing<br>can be added to an existing bedroom with furniture.<br><br>1)Use of decorative curtains.<br><br>These are called as "valances" are a very good means to decorate the <br>windows and other openings. These decorative curtains have 2 purposes.<br>a) They define a window opening b) They diffuse the incoming sunlight<br>and help the dispersion of light evenly. Valances can be easily be <br>prepared at home with some basic knowledge of stitching.<br><br>2)Wall Hangings<br> <br>Wall hangings are used as an alternative for wall paintings.<br>These have a great advantage that they can be prepared from almost<br>any material. Some possible options for material use could be<br>matt finished paper, handmade paper, silk cloth, bamboo sticks,<br>jeans cloth!, wool, plastic sheets, crape papers, etc...<br>Small square pieces of these materials along with bits of mirrors <br>pieces can be creatively used to prepare a wall hanging.<br><br>3)Wall Paintings.<br><br>The choice of the painting in this case highly depends upon the<br>likes/dislikes of the user. Also the nature of the surface on which<br>the painting is going to be, is also important.<br><br>4)Photographs<br><br>Most people like to use framed photographs of the family members,<br>ancestors, or some live stills from outside world. This method has got<br>a great advantage. The user has got perfect control over which<br>kind of photos to choose. Photographs of real people can greatly add<br>a human touch to an interior space.<br><br>5)Statues <br><br>These greatly add to the quality of the space. In case of bedrooms<br>the statues which can add some interest to the overall theme can be <br>used. Some gift articles come in the form of statues or a watch embedded <br>in it can serve two purposes at a time. They add some grace to the <br>design and at the same time, become a useful functional piece.<br><br>6)Shade Loving Plants.<br><br>Depending upon the size of the bedroom, lots of varieties of shade<br>loving plants are available today. If the plant is a flowering one,<br>then this can be very creatively used. A flowering plant can greatly <br>add to the mood of an space because of its changing nature of<br>foliage and color.<br><br>7)Decorative Lamp Shades.<br><br>Decorative lamp shades have a very unique quality attached to<br>them. Because they are functional mostly at night times, the shape<br>of the lamp shade itself can be chosen in such a way, that will add<br>some interest in the bedroom. During its functional times a lampshade<br>which is made of semitransparent cloth covers can add some<br>wonderful ambience in the interior space.<br><br>8)Free standing wooden partitions.<br><br>These are used in large bedroom to define certain areas of the<br>same space into different parts. for example a wooden partition<br>can be used to segregate a study space inside a bedroom or<br>a decorative wooden partition can be used to hide the direct <br>entry to the toilet, by creating a private area.<br><br>These are some of the ideas I have come up with randomly. These<br>can be a good starting point. You can always come up with more good<br>and creative ideas of your own. A very creative use of these <br>accessories can definitely cheer up an interior space<br><br>I hope this article was informative to everyone.<br><br>Copyright Shrinivas Vaidya

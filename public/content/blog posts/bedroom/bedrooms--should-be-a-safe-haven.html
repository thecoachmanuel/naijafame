Very few other places should capture our attention like that of the bedroom.  It doesn’t matter if you are alone in the bed or not, you might try looking at this room with Feng Shui eyes.  Feng Shui is the Chinese art of placement.  In Feng Shui, it is said to make a difference how you feel according to where you place the bed and what is around you when you sleep. Feng Shui suggests that you should feel safe and secure in a bedroom. You don’t need to practice Feng Shui to realize that.  You should also feel comfortable and very calm energy there because you spend so much time in that room. Sometimes that feeling you get speaks volumes about how you sleep and it can determine how much time you really want to spend in the bedroom.<br>When you think about the bedroom, you may be thinking about a partner or finding a partner. Since practicing Feng Shui involves a lot of metaphor; take a look around your room and see what you are telling the universe by your furniture placement and surroundings. If you have pictures around you of a figure standing alone, you are reinforcing the reality of being alone. If you want to feel more comfortable, sleep well and/or find a partner; check out a few of the following guidelines. For a total list of guidelines; check out http://www.bedding-4u.com <br>•	Place two pink candles or hearts on a side table in a bedroom; suggesting you would like a partner<br>•	Don’t have photos of family or other friends in the bedroom as this is “your” space. Pictures of you and your partner is okay<br>•	Place the bed so that the head of the head of the bed is opposite the door.  You want to easily see people as they enter<br>•	The head of the bed should not be over a window or you may feel lack of support<br>•	Don’t have a TV staring at you in bed. If you must watch TV, cover it up before you go to sleep at night<br>•	Try not to bring work home from the office; only to work on it in the bedroom. You are sending the wrong message<br>•	Do not have a lot of books surrounding your head when you sleep. All of that information could be confusing and distracting your sleep<br>•	Never place a ceiling fan above the bed because you don’t want the feeling of having fan blades above your head<br>•	Having a night table on each side of the bed suggests there is another person in the bedroom, even when you do not have a partner <br>•	Paint your bedroom pink. I painted mine pink and two weeks later I met my husband<br>•	Make sure your bedroom door opens and closes easily. Noisy doors are disturbing<br>•	Place earthy elements in a bedroom such as plants, stone, crystals or things that remind you of the earth<br>These are just a few bedroom decorating thoughts using Feng Shui as a guide. Have a clear intention of what you want in life and go about getting it. You can apply Feng Shui guidelines throughout the home and office with this ancient art and just see what a difference you will feel in your home or bedroom with a few subtle changes.<br><br>

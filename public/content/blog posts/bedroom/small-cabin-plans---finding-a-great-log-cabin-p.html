Before the internet, you would buy some cabin plans books and look through the plans to see if any appealed to you. If you found one, you could order the log cabin plan you wanted by telephone or mail. Eventually, your plans would show up. And you can still get cabin plans this way if you like.<br><br>Fast-forward to today and the internet. Here is how to use the speed and power of your PC to find small cabin plans or anything else online. Search online by putting quotation marks around your search terms so you will get the best results, like "small cabin plans" or "log cabin plan" and so on. When you arrive at a plans site, it is important to see what kind of criteria you can enter so that you only get the kind of plans that interest you. You should be able to search by:<br><br>• Cabin size in square feet<br>• Number of bedrooms<br>• Cabin style - log cabin plan, A-frame cabin, etc.<br>• Number of floors<br>• 3-D views - are they available?<br><br>Small cabin plans would generally be considered cabins that are under 1,000 square feet, for example. You should be able to only see plans under that size. The best log cabin plan sites will have additional features you can include when searching, such as kitchen layout preferred, special rooms desired, foundation type and how you want the results sorted - by most popular plans shown first, largest to smallest and so on.<br><br>After you enter your criteria, see what plans are shown. If you get too few results, maybe broaden your criteria some so you can see more plans. As you find small cabin plans that interest you, make note of the plans number in case you want to see it again. If you find a log cabin plan you really like, then you can shift your focus to examine the plans company, prices and so on. Here are questions you should want answers to:<br><br>1. How long has the plans service been in business?<br>2. Can the plans service make changes to the plans for you?<br>3. What choices do you have in plan formats?<br>4. How long will it take for your plans to be done and arrive?<br>5. Can you get a list of materials needed to build?<br><br>Remember, rather than try and create brand new small cabin plans from scratch, you can save considerably if you can find great cabin plans that have already been built successfully somewhere. This means the plans will work. Maybe you just need to make some changes to the plans so they become exactly what you want. If you can do it this way, it will be cheaper and faster for you.<br><br>As you search online for a great log cabin plan, keep a notebook of the ideas you get when you see features and concepts in cabin plans that you like. Finding the best log cabin plan for your project is so much faster and easier with the speed of the internet. Your great small cabin plans probably exist somewhere already, which means you just need to go and find them.<br><br>Copyright 2005 InfoSearch Publishing

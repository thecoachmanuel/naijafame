              <td align="left" height="12"><span class="style2">Dear friends, we as humans are a composite of mind, body and<br>spirit. All these three in proper coordination, create the<br>world around us. The things, which we want in life, are first<br>created in our mind, then our mind sends signals to our brain<br>and the brain sends signals to various parts of our body to<br>take action and thus "reality" gets created.<br><br>This means that whatever we imagine in our minds gets converted<br>in reality. The program of our mind decides what we imagine.<br>I mean if I want to decorate my bedroom, everything from the<br>type of furniture I choose to the budget decision will depend<br>upon my "broader attitude" towards life.<br><br>If I am a "budget conscious" person, then this will affect right<br>from the initial stages of the design. I will look at the design<br>from a conservative point of view. Thus everything, which gets <br>created in reality will have an influence of my personality.<br><br>Here I am not trying to say that only high budget designs are<br>good. I have seen works of many interior designers, who have<br>spent their entire lives on studying low cost design projects<br>and also have won awards for their magnificent work.<br><br>That's why any interior design project can not be fulfilled without<br>active participation of the client or the user. Creativity <br>doesn't have any boundaries of budget. Any piece of art which<br>fulfils the functional need and also the aesthetical need can<br>be easily accepted as an architectural element. Budget is<br>not a constraint at all. On the other hand the budget constraint <br>sometimes is useful to generate some good ideas for a particular<br>problem.<br><br>An interior designer is not an artist, because an artist basically<br>performs his acts to satisfy his own desire. This could be<br>any performing art or other forms of arts. His piece of work<br>may not have any functional use from user's point of view.<br><br>An interior designer is not even a technician or engineer.<br>Because when an engineer builds a design he need not worry of<br>making it "beautiful". His primary aim is to make it functional.<br>He puts his entire energy in making the design functional.<br><br>That's why an interior designer is one who satisfies both the<br>functional as well as aesthetical part of the design. Sometimes<br>it is easy to accomplish the functional part of an interior design,<br>but since the definition of beauty is different for everyone,<br>it is extremely difficult to satisfy each and every user's<br>aesthetic hunger.<br><br>This is particularly true about interiors in public spaces.<br>For example a bank building has a definite use and function for<br>all the users. We can safely create a list of functions a person<br>would perform when he visits a bank. But this does not<br>mean the bank reflects his personality, like the first paragraph<br>of this article mentions.<br><br>That's why interiors in public spaces always are designed by taking <br>into consideration something called as "mass personality".<br>This is a general attitude of the kind of mindset everyone would have<br>or is likely to have when he/she visits that space. If  you <br>visit large corporate software office premise, you will see this picture. <br><br>Office interiors always have a certain kind of order in them.<br>The use of colors, design styles have a kind of commitment in<br>them, which is expected from you when you work there.<br><br>On the other hand a bar or a restaurant has some sort of mood <br>generating atmosphere, which sets you loose. Because this is <br>what is expected in a public space like a restaurant.<br><br>Thus any interior space is always associated with people. A space<br>which serves its functions best and makes the users comfortable is<br>bound to succeed as a favorite place.<br><br>I hope this article was informative to everyone.<br><br>Copyright Shrinivas Vaidya

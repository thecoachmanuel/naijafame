      Good Bedroom Design</b></font><br>
      &nbsp;by: <font color="#FF6600"><b class="author">Shrinivas Vaidya</b> </font>
      <p>Dear friends, successful design is a relative term. What is good or 
      successful for me may not be so from your point of view. </p>
      <p>But when it comes to interior design, there are certain factors which 
      are always present no matter what the use of the space is. Let's have a 
      look at the bare minimum design factors a space must have so that it can 
      be called a comfortable and habitable space. </p>
      <p>1) Proportions of the room. </p>
      <p>The word &quot;proportions&quot; is always used in the design field. Every 
      interior space which is being used by humans must be proportionate. 
      Proportions are extremely important in any design. </p>
      <p>Every 3 dimensional object has properties such as length, width and 
      height. When these 3 are in accordance with the proportions of various 
      parts of human body we call it a &quot;proportionate&quot; design. </p>
      <p>For example a handle of a wardrobe must have dimensions such that our 
      fingers can hold it properly for effortless and smooth action. or a chair 
      seat must have enough are so that we can sit comfortably. Again the type 
      of seating will change the dimensions of the chair. A chair in waiting 
      lobby of a bank will be different than a sofa. </p>
      <p>So proportions play a major role in interior design and furniture in 
      your bedroom must also follow these rules. The dimensions of the double 
      bed, it's height from floor level, height of wardrobe, dimensions of 
      dressing table, etc...all these matter as far as function is concerned.
      </p>
      <p>2) Natural light entering the room. </p>
      <p>There is no alternative for naturally lit spaces. Sun being the 
      strongest source of light and also helps to keep the biological balance of 
      the planet Earth, it is very much necessary in the interior spaces. </p>
      <p>Study shows that natural light can penetrate in an interior space up to 
      20 feet (Approx. 7 meters). Using appropriate position for window opening 
      can easily achieve this. </p>
      <p>3) Natural Ventilation </p>
      <p>A free and unobstructed flow of air can be a great way to keep the 
      atmosphere cool and clean in an interior space. This is possible where 
      bedrooms are located at the corner of the building where 2 sides of the 
      bedrooms have external faces. </p>
      <p>Where it is not possible to provide windows on adjacent faces or 
      opposite faces, a ventilator above the window is used. The concept behind 
      the ventilator is simple. The lower half the bedroom height is always used 
      by the habitants. Because of the constant use of this are the air 
      temperature rises and air becomes light weight. </p>
      <p>This hot air rises above and must need an escape. At such times 
      ventilators above the window openings play a major role of circulating the 
      flow through the room in an upward direction. When the lower portion of 
      the room becomes empty fresh air from window takes its position, thus 
      maintaining a balance. </p>
      <p>4) Clear Movement Patterns. </p>
      <p>Every bedroom has certain exit points attached to it. Such as </p>
      <p>a) Exit to balcony/ terrace. <br>
      b) Exit to toilet block/ walk in closet <br>
      c) Exit to backyard (if on ground floor) </p>
      <p>If we draw an imaginary line from the entry point to all these exit 
      points, ideally the should not intersect. Since all other areas are 
      already occupied with furniture, keeping the inside circulation space 
      clear, helps to achieve a comfortable space. </p>
      <p>5) Good Provision For Inclusion Of Accessories. </p>
      <p>Accessories in a bedroom have equal importance. When all other factors 
      mentioned above are fairly met what remains is the use of accessories 
      which can make quite a lot of difference in the comfort level of the 
      habitants. </p>
      <p>a) The first and the most important is a good provision of artificial 
      lighting. This includes basic lighting as well as special decorative 
      lighting for decorative purposes. </p>
      <p>b) Special provision for upholstery and linen. Small details such as 
      curtain rods, provision for bed canopies can make the room extra 
      decorative. </p>
      <p>c) Use materials that are easy to clean and maintain. For example if 
      you are using PVC flooring sheets on top of standard tiled flooring, is it 
      washable? Think of what will happen if your child uses it as a painting 
      canvas. </p>
      <p>The discussion above was an attempt to look for some universal factor 
      that can affect the comfort level of the users in a bedroom. Finally the 
      feeling which you get when you use your bedroom is most important and is a 
      good measure to decide the success factor of the design project. </p>
      <p>However it is important to note that these are not the only factors 
      that need to be looked upon, but I'm sure these can help as a starting 
      point for further creative thinking. </p>
      <p>I hope this article was informative to everyone. </p>

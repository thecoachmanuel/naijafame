              <td align="left" height="12"><span class="style2">If you have come to a point in your life that you want a serious relationship, I would strongly suggest that you “think pink”.  This may sound strange to some of you, but I have discovered that the color “pink” has some interesting qualities.  Pink is definitely a girly color, and it speaks of love, romance and partnership.  Pink flowers, hearts, and just about anything else this color makes you feel soft and feminine.  What woman doesn’t love receiving even a single pink rose?  The majority of the time you will think of pink for baby bedding if you are expecting a girl.  Most of the gifts you receive at a baby shower will be pink for your newborn girl. Don’t stop using pink for your bedding after you have grown up.  There are lots of things you can do to enhance your bedroom when it comes to finding partnership and having a pink duvet cover or bedspread is just one of them.<br><br>I really wanted a serious relationship in my life so I decided to use the color pink to my advantage.  If you have read about the principals of Feng Shui, you know that pink is an important color to enhance partnerships and when used in the bedroom wonderful and magical things can happen.  With the intention of a loving relationship clearly in my mind, I went out and purchased a pink comforter and sheets to match for my bed.  It had only a small tonal design, but I didn’t want a lot of other flowers or patterns getting in the way.  The color was what mattered to me, the thing that was going to jumpstart my quest for the ideal relationship. I put my new pink bedding on the minute I got home from the store and visualized what this new man would look like and the kinds of things we would do as a couple.  I didn’t stop redecorating my room with just the pink bed linen; throw pillows in different shades of pink were called for as well. I already had several vintage velvet pillows in the shape of hearts that were perfect. I put white lace accents around the dresser representing the lace from a wedding dress. I placed two pink candles beside the bed and immediately lit them both.  Two is better than one because this also reinforces the pair and not just one single candle standing alone.  I found beautiful artwork that went well with the new bedding.  I had fresh pink roses in my bedroom everyday. If you want new linen for your bedroom, check out http://www.bedding-4u.com.<br><br> I also cleared out my closet of all the stuff I no longer wore, gave it to charity and created a “space” for the man coming into my life.  I went through my drawers as well, and it felt good to get rid of some of the stuff I was hanging on to.  You’d be surprised what you find when you go through your stuff. Clearing the clutter out of your life is also a Feng Shui principal that opens the way for something new to enter in; out with the old and in with the new as they say.  Are you starting to get an idea of how you can use some common sense things to assist you in finding your right relationship?<br><br>If all of this pink, hearts and flowers are beginning to look too much like bubblegum, just take a moment and think about how you would like your bedroom to look.  There are many shades of pink.  You don’t have to buy a duvet cover or comforter that looks like it belongs to a ten year old.  Some of the salmon and mauve shades available in the bedding department are very sophisticated.  If you aren’t excited about lace and velvet, why not try satin with silver accents or how about rich chintz or beefy jacquards?  Look for things that mean something to you. You might also have a family piece that your mother gave you, and every time you look at it, it reminds you of your parent’s happy and enduring marriage. This is even more helpful when placed with intention in the room. If you find a beautiful modern bronze sculpture of a couple entwined, go for it.  You might see the perfect heart grapevine wreath with roses, so hang it with love and the thoughts of things to come.  If pink sheets aren’t called for, why not paint the room a warm rose and change the curtains or draperies?  It would still be a nice touch to buy new bedding, even if it is a shade of gray or blue as you are “preparing” your room for someone new.  The style in which you decorate doesn’t matter.  The intention behind the changes you make is what counts. <br><br>Take a look at your own bedroom<br>Take a look at your own bedroom.  If you want a serious relationship, what are you saying to the universe about yourself through the colors of your bedding, decorating themes and the shape of your closets and drawers?  Do you have artwork on the wall that is of a woman standing alone looking at the ocean, or is the woman sitting alone on a park bench?  Do you have only one end table beside the side of the bed that you sleep on?  You may want to consider putting one on the other side too, inviting that other person in. Are you starting to see that what you have around you speaks volumes about what you believe about yourself and what you think is possible?<br><br>You may be wondering if the “pink” work its magic.  Did someone new come into my life? Of course the color pink doesn’t possess powers that mysteriously draws people to you.  However, when you focus on a goal with a clear intention, you will draw energy to that goal.  Plain and simple, it is the law of the universe. You will be assisted in achieving the goal and the “pink” can work to help you.  The same Feng Shui principal applies to whatever you want in life, a new career, more money, better health and so on.  By the way, I met my husband one week after I put the pink bedding on my bed and made my other changes.  You decide for yourself if you would like to “think pink” to change your life.<br><br>

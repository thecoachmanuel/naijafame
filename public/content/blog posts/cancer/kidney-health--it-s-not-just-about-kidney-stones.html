              <td align="left" height="12"><span class="style2">A kidney is a reddish brown, bean-shaped organ that filters<br>waste minerals and toxins from the blood. The kidneys<br>regulate acid concentration and the kidneys maintain the<br>water balance in the human body by producing urine.<br><br>Kidneys also make hormones that help keep bones strong blood healthy.<br><br>Kidneys that aren't functioning properly allow harmful<br>toxins to build up. This may causes blood pressure to rise,<br>the body will accumulate fluids, and may not produce enough<br>red blood cells.<br><br>Here are the most common kidney problems.<br><br>Kidney Stones: A kidney stone is a hard mass that<br>accumulates in the urinary tract when crystals separate from<br>the urine and build up on the inner surfaces of the kidney.<br>In most people, urine contains chemicals that prevent these<br>crystals from forming kidney stones. People who suffer from<br>kidney stones, for reasons that aren't always completely<br>understood, don't have inhibitors that prevent crystal<br>formation.<br><br>Anyone who has ever had kidney stones will tell you the pain<br>can be so severe that it reduces them to tears.<br><br>Kidney stones are not a product of modern diets or<br>lifestyle. Evidence of kidney stones has been found in 7000<br>year old human remains in Egypt.<br><br>Men tend to get kidney stones more often than women.<br><br>Kidney Infections: If a person has low resistance, germs<br>from the bladder can travel up the ureters to the kidneys<br>and begin to multiply. An acute kidney infection starts<br>suddenly with severe symptoms, then quickly comes to an end. A chronic kidney infection develops slowly and grows worse with time. A chronic kidney infection can lead to kidney<br>failure.<br><br>Kidney Cysts: A kidney cyst is an abnormal pouch that<br>contains fluid. The simple kidney cyst is the most common<br>form.<br><br>The cause of a simple kidney cyst isn't completely understood. But there's no evidence that kidney cysts are an inherited condition. One or more kidney cysts may develop at<br>a time on the small tubes in the kidneys.<br><br>Kidney cysts do not generally present symptoms and usually<br>kidney cysts  cause no harm. Very often people don't even<br>know they have a kidney cyst. However, a kidney cyst can<br>cause pain if it grows large enough to press on other<br>organs.<br><br>Sometimes a kidney cyst can become infected and start to<br>bleed. If that happens, a kidney cyst can increase blood<br>pressure, but it usually don't impair kidney function.<br><br>A kidney cyst won't require treatment if no complications<br>are present.  But if symptoms occur, a kidney cyst may<br>require surgery.<br><br>Kidney Cancer: Kidney cancer accounts for approximately<br>three percent of all adult cancers in the United States. The<br>American Cancer Society reports that more than 30,000 new<br>cases of kidney cancer are diagnosed each year and about<br>12,000 people die from kidney cancer annually.<br><br>Kidney cancer tends to appear in adults in middle age,<br>usually after age 50. Kidney cancer strikes men twice as<br>often as women.<br><br>The most common type of kidney cancer occurs in the part of<br>the kidney that filters blood and produces the urine. This<br>type of kidney cancer is called renal cell cancer, or renal<br>cell carcinoma. Another type of adult kidney cancer is a<br>tumor which arises in the part of the kidney where the urine<br>collects. This type of kidney cancer is called transitional<br>cell carcinoma. The most frequent sign of kidney cancer in<br>adults is blood in the urine.<br><br>Symptoms and treatment for the kidney disorders described<br>above can be found at http://www.kidneys.name and http://www.kidneystones.name

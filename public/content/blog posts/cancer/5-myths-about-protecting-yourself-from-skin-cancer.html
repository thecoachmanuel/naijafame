<br>mild climate and is very athletic. She loves to swim, bike and
<br>play games outdoors. Sara knows the dangers of the sun and so she
<br>opts for tanning salons to get her 'golden glow' while being sure
<br>to apply sunscreen every day before heading out. 
<br>
<br>Joseph lives in a cooler, northern climate. The summers can be
<br>very humid, but most of the year is mild or even below freezing
<br>during the harshest winter months. The beach has never been much
<br>of a draw for him and he spends most of his time doing indoor
<br>activities or at his job. Joseph doesn't worry about sunscreen
<br>and only had one sunburn that he can remember and that was when
<br>he was a child. 
<br>
<br>-------------------- 
<br>
<br>Which of these examples do you most associate yourself with? Did
<br>you know that Sara and Joseph are both at risk of developing skin
<br>cancer? We have all heard the warnings about the dangers of sun
<br>exposure. We know all about the importance of wearing sunscreen
<br>and hats. But are YOU protected from skin cancer? Consider these
<br>myths and facts: 
<br>
<br>MYTH ONE: Tanning Beds are Safer than the Sun 
<br>
<br>20 minutes of exposure in a tanning bed is roughly equivalent to
<br>four hours in the sun. Although sun beds use UVA rather than UVB
<br>rays, 'The Skin Cancer Answer' states that "UV-A penetrates more
<br>deeply into the skin than UV-B, can cause skin cancer, and may
<br>suppress the immune system." 
<br>
<br>MYTH TWO: Wearing Sunscreen at the Beach is Protection 
<br>
<br>85 percent of UV rays can even make it through on cloudy days.
<br>That means you are equally at risk in the car, walking the dog or
<br>letting your children out to play at any time of year - even when
<br>you're not at the beach. Of course, you are usually less attired
<br>at the beach and so covering up is recommended even when wearing
<br>sunscreen. Sunscreen also wears off with sweat and water and
<br>should always be applied every two hours or after getting wet. 
<br>
<br>MYTH THREE: Taking Care Of Your Skin Now Will Protect You 
<br>
<br>Sadly, skin cancer can take 20 or more years to develop. The Skin
<br>Cancer Foundation states that most people receive about 80
<br>percent of their lifetime sun exposure before the age of 18. 
<br>Just one blistering sunburn in childhood is estimated to double
<br>the risk of melanoma later in life. Taking better care now will
<br>reduce the risk, but not eliminate the damage already done. 
<br>
<br>MYTH FOUR: Having a Tan Means You're More Protected 
<br>
<br>Dark skinned individuals are less likely to develop cancer, but
<br>tanned skin is actually damaged skin. Repeated tanning injures
<br>the skin and increases the risk of skin cancer. 
<br>
<br>
<br>MYTH FIVE: You Can't get Burned on Overcast Days
<br>
<br>Just because the sun is hidden by some cloud does not mean that 
<br>you don't need protection from the harmful effects of the suns rays.
<br>
<br>
<br>So how do you plan to protect your family this year? Some
<br>suggestions are to limit exposure to the sun - especially for
<br>infants. Examine your skin for early signs of damage. Use a
<br>sunscreen of SPF 15 or higher and apply it at least 30 minutes
<br>before exposure and every two hours after that. Teach your
<br>children good safety habits and be sure you and they are covered
<br>up when outdoors. Have fun and be safe.

              <td align="left" height="12"><span class="style2">There are many nutrition supplements at your local health food<br>store. So many to choose from so confusing which ones are the<br>right ones. How many should you take? Here you will learn what<br>you need to take for the best health benefits. A word of warning<br>here although these products are convenient getting some of your<br>nutrition in liquid form or capsules is only recommended when<br>you can't eat properly or you feel you are not getting your<br>proper daily nutrients. The companies that make the products<br>themselves mostly fund the studies of meal replacements, and the<br>manufactures usually test their supplements against similar<br>supplements not the benefits of whole foods. BORON WILL AID IN<br>THE DEFENSE OF PROSTATE CANCER A high level of this mineral will<br>help reduce the chances of getting prostate cancer by 65%. US<br>males have a one of the lowest boron levels compared to other<br>countries. <br><br>Only 3 milligrams daily help fight cancer and studies show also<br>improve memory and concentration. <br><br>Boron is not in stock at all health food stores. It is also<br>naturally found in raisins and almonds. <br><br>CALCIUM FOR STRONG BONES AND WEIGHT LOSS Many men are not<br>getting the daily allowance of 1,000 mg. A cup of milk has only<br>300 mg. It has been found that men with high calcium levels<br>weigh less than men with low levels of calcium. <br><br>A dosage of 1,200 mg is preferred. Make sure you have calcium<br>citrate it is the purist form. Take half dose in the morning and<br>half at night. Avoid coral calcium it has some impurities. <br><br>If you get your 3 servings of calcium daily you won't need any<br>more. You could exceed your maximum daily intake 2,500 mg. <br><br>CHROMIUM HELPS FIGHT THE CAUSES OF DIABETES It is used to assist<br>in muscle-building, but now research has revealed that chromium<br>can help overweight people control insulin levels. Chromium<br>helps the body's response to insulin, this makes it better to<br>keep the levels of blood-sugar in check. <br><br>The most effective form of this supplement is chromium<br>picolinate. A 35-microgram dose daily is sufficient. Check with<br>your doctor to see if you need to increase the dosage to 200<br>mcg, if you have a diabetic condition. <br><br>COENZYME Q10 FOR A SURE ENERGY SPIKE Coenzyme Q10 is produced in<br>the body it assists the cells by directing your body's energy<br>supply. As men get older the production levels diminishes. One<br>way to revitalize these levels is by taking this supplement.<br>Current research proves coenzyme Q10 can possibly aid in the<br>fight against cancer, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease,<br>and could help prevent heart disease by thinning the blood. Q10<br>also can be used as an antioxidant that helps slow the aging<br>process by fighting free radicals. <br><br>A dose of 100mg daily is suggested. If you are taking statin<br>drug for cholesterol or high blood pressure you can increase the<br>dosage to 200mg. <br><br>CREATINE FOR THAT MUSCLE AND MEMORY SPIKE Studies from the<br>University of Wisconsin have shown a boost in men's bench press<br>on the average of 15 lbs and also increase in the squat exercise<br>weight by 21 lbs just by taking over a 2-3 month period. Aussie<br>studies have also suggested that tests with memory and<br>intelligence scores increased after 6 weeks of creatine use. <br><br>A recommended dosage of 5 mg daily mixed with a whey protein<br>supplement to get highest possible advantage. <br><br>It is possible you won't respond to creatine alone. You can mix<br>in a sugar substitute a see if this will help get a response. <br><br>FOLIC ACID TO SLASH ALZHEIMER'S DANGERS This supplement will<br>increase blood flow to the brain by preventing clotting of<br>arteries. Folic acid will also lower the levels of an amino acid<br>called (homocysteine) that can cause blood clots. A warning sign<br>of Alzheimer's is high homocysteine levels. Sweden studies have<br>shown low levels of folic acid were found in Alzheimer's<br>patients. <br><br>A 500 mg dose if preferred daily. This dose should decrease<br>homocysteine by almost 18% or more. You can get folic acid from<br>these foods citrus fruit, beans, and breads and cereals that are<br>fortified. <br><br>GLOUCOSAMINE WILL LUBRACATE THOSE JOINTS As men grow older the<br>cartilage in the joints decreases. You can turn back the hands<br>of time by using gloucosamine to repair and rebuild any harm to<br>the cartilage you may have received over time. Crab and lobster<br>shells are the main ingredients in gloucosamine. Lancet<br>published a 3-year research study that showed 200 people that<br>had joint conditions had reduced stiffness and pain by 25% by<br>using gloucosamine. A12 week treatment program by The British<br>Journal of Sports Medicine reported an 88% reduction of joint<br>related problems by using gloucosamine on patients. A 1,500 dose<br>daily is sufficient for a good response. A combination of<br>gloucosamine with chondroitin will bring that cartilage right<br>back to those early days. A study from Australia showed that<br>spreading a gloucosamine cream of painful joints could relieve<br>some pain. <br><br>OMEGA-3S YOUR HEART HEALER This supplement will aid in keeping<br>high blood pressure and low triglycerides in check. Omega-3<br>fatty acids make the blood flow better, thus lower the chances<br>of blood clots that could block the arteries. A high omega-3<br>count has shown to lower the some conditions related to heart<br>disease. <br><br>If you in good health a dose of 1,000 mg is fine. For those in<br>the high-risk heart disease group you may need 2,000-4,000 mg. A<br>doctor will know what dosage is best. A side effect of to much<br>omega-3 is a greater chance of catching a cold. <br><br>A 500 mg gelcap twice daily with meals will keep that ticker<br>beating too the right tune. <br><br>SELENIUM YOUR ALL OUT CANCER DEFENDER This could be the your<br>best choice for the fight against cancer. This nutrient has<br>caused most cancer cells to tear down by them selves. Some<br>studies have shown that selenium has lower some risk of cancers<br>related to the colon, lungs, and prostate. <br><br>A dose of 200 mg daily is recommended. If you're sick taking<br>more possibly will reduce the length of your sickness. Some<br>research has shown that deceased levels of selenium have made<br>some virus change, making symptoms worse for the flu and for<br>colds. <br><br>In nature certain nuts like The Brazil nut, contain as much as<br>100 mcg per nut. <br><br>VITAMIN E TO BRING THE EFFECT OF AGING TO A CRAWL Said to be the<br>best antioxidant around today. This vitamin has been linked to<br>lower cases of heart disease, some eye conditions, and some<br>cancers. Some research has lead nutrition specialists to<br>recommend Vitamin E after exercise because of its ability to<br>lower muscle problems related to exercising. A dose of at least<br>400 IU is preferred daily. Most people only receive a portion of<br>this dose about 45 IU by way of a multivitamin. To get more<br>Vitamin E in your diet increase your intake of nuts and oils. <br><br>Try to get natural Vitamin E called (d-alpha tocopherol) this is<br>easier for the body to absorb. <br><br>If you are confused about which type of multivitamin to buy here<br>are some pointers. A multivitamin helps lower heart disease,<br>possible stroke, and reduces risks of diabetes. There are<br>several on the market. Look for multivitamin that has 100% of<br>daily allowances of the 16 core nutrients. With extra dose of<br>illness busters -like lutein, lycopene, and selenium. Try and<br>avoid extra iron this could lead a higher risk of heart<br>conditions. <br>

How is it then that in a poll 96% of men knew nothing at all about the prostate gland. <br><br>Prostate Cancer is the most common diagnosed cancer in the USA and UK. Next to lung cancer it is the second leading cause of cancer death in men in the USA." <br><br>Women know more about men's health than men do themselves and that's a fact. Why is that? Is it because we find it hard to discuss these things? Is it because it's not macho! From the time that we are young, we are taught that boys have to act tough and shouldn't cry. You must have heard the saying "Big Boys don't cry!"<br><br>Most of us carry this thought process into adulthood and feel by showing concern for our health, it will be seen as a male weakness. I am guilty of that myself.<br><br>I know when my prostate troubles began, I knew absolutely nothing about the prostate. I was one of the 96%. Mainly because it didn't cross my mind that I'd ever have any problems.<br><br>In addition, the prostate is in a "private" area, and it wasn't something I wanted to examine. Many people, including myself, feel uncomfortable talking about the prostate, since the gland plays a role in both sex and urination.<br><br>I have had prostate troubles, survived a cancer scare and watched my sister die from Cancer. Believe me, when I say that when you think you are going to die, it concentrates your mind on what is really important. Suddenly your priorities get focused.<br><br>Due to my prostate troubles, I became interested in learning about the prostate and how it affected my health.<br><br>I cried the day they took a biopsy and I cried with relief the day I was told it was benign. I cried many times as I watched my sister die.<br><br>I got so frustrated having to get up every night 3-4 times due to my prostate troubles and then finding I couldn't get back to sleep.<br><br>What is prostate cancer?<br><br>Prostate Cancer develops by the growth of cancerous cells within the prostate gland. Prostate cancer occurs when some of the cells that make up the prostate gland escape from the normal controls on their growth and start to divide, grow and spread in an uncontrolled manner. In its advanced form, it can produce the same symptoms as BPH. (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia)<br><br>Warning Signs<br><br>Early prostate cancer often does not cause symptoms. When symptoms of prostate cancer do occur, they may include some of the following problems:<br><br>A need to urinate frequently, especially at night; Difficulty starting urination or holding back urine; Inability to urinate; Weak or interrupted flow of urine; Painful or burning urination; Painful ejaculation; Blood in urine or semen; and/or Frequent pain or stiffness in the lower back, hips, or upper thighs.<br><br>Any of these symptoms may be caused by cancer or by other, less serious health problems, such as BPH or an infection (Prostatitis). Only a doctor can tell the cause. A man who has symptoms like these should see his family doctor . Do not wait to feel pain; early prostate cancer does not cause pain.<br><br>These are two other main prostate problems<br><br>1) BPH - (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) is the abnormal growth of benign prostate cells. In an enlarged prostate , the prostate grows larger and pushes against the urethra and bladder, blocking the normal flow of urine. BPH is often the result of prostatitis.<br><br>2) Prostatitis refers to prostate inflammation and infection, which can be brief or long-lasting, mild or severe symptoms can include frequent, urgent and painful urination, erectile problems or pain during ejaculation.<br><br>Prostatitis is rampant in the US, affecting at least 80% of American men. Most is without major symptoms. Prostate enlargement, called Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy (BPH) is often the result of prostatitis.<br><br>Treatment for Prostate Cancer<br><br>The treatment given for prostate cancer depends on how advanced or widespread the disease is. If the cancer is small and only present within the prostate gland, it is possible to treat it with<br><br>surgery (radical prostatectomy) radiotherapy (either external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy) hormone therapy<br><br>I sincerely hope that this article can be of use to you, your partner, someone in your family or indeed a close friend.<br><br>Health to me is both physical and mental. The two cannot be separated. May I leave you with what I regard the finest bits of advice for life<br><br>*************************************** If I were asked to give what I consider the single most useful bit of advice for all humanity it would be this: Expect trouble as an inevitable part of life and when it comes, hold your head high, look it squarely in the eye and say, "I will be bigger than you. You cannot defeat me." ...........Ann Landers ****************************************<br><br>I wish you perfect health and piece of mind in all that you do .<br><br>Jeff Cuckson<br>webmaster@backtobetterhealth.com <br>****************************************<br>Discover Real People With Stories Of Success In Getting Back To Good Health.

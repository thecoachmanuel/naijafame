              <td align="left" height="12"><span class="style2">One rare form of cancer is called Mesothelioma, a <br>malignant tumor in the mesothelial tissues of the lungs <br>and the abdomen, arising from the inhalation of asbestos. <br>Its rarity is one of the reasons why a lot of people are <br>not aware of this kind of fatal disease. In fact, many <br>people die of Mesothelioma undiagnosed. Although there is <br>now a growing awareness of the hazards of asbestos to <br>health, still many have not heard of Mesothelioma and <br>thus, have not understood its nature, cause, signs and <br>treatment. Even some physicians find it hard to detect <br>Mesothelioma because its symptoms are akin to other <br>diseases like lung cancer and pneumonia. Furthermore, it <br>takes decades for a patient who was exposed to asbestos to <br>develop Mesothelioma — fifty years, at most. <br><br>Being unaware of Mesothelioma poses higher risks since it <br>deters diagnosis and treatment. A person undergoing <br>treatment must know the different stages of the cancer or <br>the extent of the disease. Chances of recovering from <br>Mesothelioma and the kind of treatment depend on the stage <br>of the illness. There are basically two staging systems <br>used for Pleural Mesothelioma (lungs): TNM system and <br>Brighan system. These staging systems are also used in <br>other kinds of cancers; however, the first is commonly <br>used. There is no established method in determining the <br>stage of the Peritoneal Mesothelioma cancer (abdominal) so <br>the TNM system is used.<br><br>There are three variables in the TNM system: tumor, lymph <br>nodes and metastasis. In the earliest stage of <br>Mesothelioma, stage I, the malignant Mesothelioma cells <br>start to grow and multiply only one layer of the pleura. <br>The pleura is the membrane that encloses the lungs and <br>lines the wall of the chest cavity. However, there are <br>some instances wherein the pericardium (membrane that <br>covers the heart) and diaphragm cover are already <br>affected. In this case, the cancer patient is still in <br>stage I Mesothelioma. <br><br>In the second stage, the two layers of the pleura are <br>already affected by Mesothelioma. Take note, however, that <br>in this stage, only one side of the body is affected. <br>Normally, the pleura produces only small amount of <br>lubricating fluid that allows easy expanding and <br>contracting of the lungs. The excess fluid is absorbed by <br>the blood and the lymph vessels so there’s a balance <br>between the amount of fluid produced and removed. During <br>the second stage Mesothelioma, fluid starts to build up <br>between the membrane of the lungs and the membrane of the <br>chest wall, resulting to pleural effusion. The increase in <br>the volume of fluid produced causes shortness of breath <br>and chest pain. Other Mesothelioma cancer patients <br>experience dry and persistent cough. Diagnosis of the <br>pleural effusion is achieved through a chest x-ray.<br><br>Stage III Mesothelioma means that the malignant cells have <br>already spread to the chest wall, esophagus and the lymph <br>nodes on one part of the chest. The patient may suffer <br>severe pain near the parts affected. When not treated <br>immediately or when the Mesothelioma patient doesn’t <br>respond well to medication, the cancer may advance to the <br>fourth stage. The fourth stage Mesothelioma is formidable <br>since at this stage the Mesothelioma cells have penetrated <br>into the bloodstream and other organs in the body like the <br>liver, the bones and the brain. The lymph nodes on the <br>other side of the chest may also be affected by <br>Mesothelioma in stage IV.<br><br>Brighan staging system, on the other hand, determines <br>whether the Mesothelioma can be surgically removed or not <br>and whether the lymph nodes are affected or not. In stage <br>I Mesothelioma, the lymph nodes are not yet affected and <br>the patient can still recover through surgery. In stage <br>II, surgery can still be executed but some lymph nodes <br>have already been infiltrated by the cancer cells. In <br>stage III, the heart and chest wall are already affected; <br>thus, surgery is no longer advisable. The lymph nodes in <br>this stage, however, may or may not be affected. In the <br>final stage, stage IV Mesothelioma, cancer cells have <br>already gone to the bloodstream and other parts of the <br>body like the heart, brain, bone and liver. In most cases, <br>a patient who has reached stage IV Mesothelioma only has <br>four to twenty-four months to live.<br><br><br>

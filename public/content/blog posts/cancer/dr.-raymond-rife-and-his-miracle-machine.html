              <td align="left" height="12"><span class="style2">I'm willing to take a chance here and bet my next paycheck that you've never heard of Dr. Raymond Rife, nor of his amazing machines.<br><br>Did I win? I thought so. <br><br>Would you be surprised to learn that Dr. Rife developed a system, more than 70 years ago, which safely and quickly kills viruses, bacteria, Candida, fungus, parasites, and even cancer, with no side effects, and no toxicity?<br><br>This remarkable technology was invented by a humble man, with no formal medical training, who not only realized that common pathogens could be literally "exploded" by submitting them to a resonant frequency (similar to the way a soprano can shatter a wine glass by singing the resonant frequency), but he also invented and machined a 5,300 part microscope which use polarized light to watch these microorganisms as they were annihilated.<br><br> In 1934, the University of Southern California appointed a Special Medical Research Committee to bring 16 terminal cancer patients from Pasadena County Hospital to Rife's San Diego Laboratory and clinic for treatment. The team included doctors and pathologists assigned to examine the patients, if still alive, in 90 days. After the 3 months of treatment, the Committee concluded that 14 of the patients had been completely cured. The treatment was then adjusted and the remaining 2 also were cured within the next 4 weeks. On November 20, 1931, forty-four of the nation's most respected medical authorities honored Royal Rife with a banquet billed as "The End To All Diseases" at the Pasadena estate of Dr Milbank Johnson.<br><br>But by 1939, almost all of these distinguished doctors and scientists were denying that they had ever met Rife. This complete reversal was the result of pressure from the drug companies on them. 'Pressure' is a very nice way of saying it. On the eve of a press conference to announce the results of the 1934 study on Rife's cancer therapy, Dr Milbank Johnson, former president of the Southern California AMA, was fatally poisoned and his papers "lost". Also, after a failed attempt by Morris Fishbein to buy the rights to Rife's healing instrument for the medical drug industry, Rife's labs were destroyed by arson and sabotage. Dr. Nemes, who had duplicated some of the work of Rife, was killed in a mysterious fire which destroyed all his research papers. A similar fire also destroyed the Burnett Lab, which was validating Rife's work. Royal Rife himself was killed in 1971 by an "accidental" lethal dose of Valium and alcohol at Grossmont Hospital.<br><br>Participating in the original 1934 USC study were the following people: Director of the Northwestern Medical School Arthur Kendall, president of USC Rufus Klein-Schmidt, Milbank Johnson, Edward Kopps of the Metabolic Clinic in La Jolla, George Fischer of the NY Childrens Hospital, Kurt Meyer of the Hooper Foundation in San Francisco, and the Chief Surgeon of Santa Fe Railway Whalen Morrison. Dr Milbank Johnson, who was the professor of Physiology and Clinical Medicine at USC, and chairman of the Special Medical Research Committee, operated his own cancer clinic utilizing the Rife therapy for 10 years. He was able to document many cases of cancer reversal there.<br><br>The United States medical establishment has not been particularly receptive to Dr. Rife's research since then, in spite of the numerous anecdotal cases of complete cancer remission, as well as full remission from hundreds of other symptoms, from auto-immune disorders to tuberculosis.

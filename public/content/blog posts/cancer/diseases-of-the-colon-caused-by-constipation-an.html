              <td align="left" height="12"><span class="style2">It was estimated that of all the people who died of cancer – colon, lung, prostate, and breast - in 1999 sixteen percent were attributed to colon cancer. But, how many of these other cancers originated in your colon? We do know that colon cancer is the second leading cause of deaths in the United States.<br><br>We don’t know what cancers originated in your colon because the medical profession treats symptoms not the causes. Many doctors do not go looking for the cause of your problem. They don’t have the time. In fact, they normally will not tell you what you need to do to prevent your illness. Sometimes the reason they will not tell you is they just do not know.<br><br>It is the nutritionist’s job to tell you what foods and supplements you need to prevent and to overcome specific illnesses and what to eat to eliminate or stop constipation.<br><br>Why is it that some many people are dying of various diseases at such an early age – at forty, at fifty, at sixty, even 30, or younger? They die of heart diseases, blood diseases, cancers, autoimmune diseases and the list goes on. It has been know for a longtime why diseases occur and what you can do to prevent it.<br><br>These death producing illnesses are a result of our life style - the foods we eat, the water we drink, the air pollution we breathe, the thoughts we think, the toxins we are exposed to at work, and the cleaning products we use at home.<br><br>What is it that causes us to behave in a way that is harmful to others or ourselves in ways that affect our health, our relationships, and our life? Why do people smoke when they know it causes Cancer? Why do people drink coffee when they know caffeine affects their adrenal gland, which eventually leads to exhaustion? Why is it that people eat sugar when they know it has untold health effects beyond diabetes? The answer is simple but difficult to accept.<br><br>All illness originates from repressed traumatic memories resulting from early life trauma.<br><br>Dr Arthur Janov explains this clearly in his book, 1996, Why You Get Sick How You Get Well.<br><br>“Over the last thirty years I have learned a great deal about humans and what drives them. As trite as it may seem, what I have found is a single yet complex emotion called love. Not the romantic love of novels, but a fundamental love – the love of a parent for a child. When a child lacks love and nurturing, no matter how that lack is manifest, it creates pain, and if this pain is not “felt” or integrated into the system, it will in turn cause physical and emotional illness in later life.”<br><br>It takes disciple to change behavior, thought, and life style, which are good for health. This is what is necessary to reduce or eliminate illness. This is what is necessary to bring on a feeling of well-being way into your old age – at 80, at 90, at 100, and well beyond that. With the new anti-aging nutrients and supplements on the market, I can see people living well into 120 years provided they follow a good lifestyle.<br><br>How many people are willing to devote the time and money to start eating the right foods and change their lifestyle? This is the first step in reducing or eliminating constipation.

              <td align="left" height="12"><span class="style2">Although most people love the warmth and light of the sun, too much<br>sun exposure can significantly damage human skin. The sun's heat dries<br>out areas of unprotected skin and to deplete the skin's supply of<br>natural lubricating oils. In addition, the sun's ultraviolet (UV)<br>radiation can cause burning and long-term changes in the skin's<br>structure.<br>Actinic keratosis is a skin condition characterized by rough, scaly<br>patches on the skin of our face, lips, ears, back of your hands,<br>forearms, scalp and neck. It's caused by frequent or intense exposure<br>to ultraviolet (UV) rays, typically from the sun. Many doctors<br>consider actinic keratosis to be precancerous because it may develop<br>into skin cancer. also known as solar keratoses, grow slowly and<br>usually cause no signs or symptoms other than patches or small spots<br>on the skin. These lesions take years to develop, usually first<br>appearing in older adults. Left untreated, about one in 10 cases of<br>actinic keratoses develop into squamous cell carcinoma, a serious form<br>of skin cancer. It does not also go away unless it is frozen,<br>(chemically)naturally treated with Curaderm, or removed by a doctor.<br>About one in every 400 patches of actinic keratosis eventually changes<br>into a squamous cell cancer of the skin.<br>The type of treatment that will work best for you depends on many<br>factors, including the number, size and location of<br>your actinic keratoses.<br>There is no immediate treatment, but the doctor regularly monitors the<br>area of abnormal skin to see if it develops an<br>appearance more worrisome for cancer.<br>Also, because an actinic keratosis is a sign that you are at increased<br>risk of skin cancer, your doctor will schedule regular follow-up skin<br>examinations to check periodically for new areas of abnormal skin.<br>Prevent reducing your risk of actinic keratosis by minimizing your sun<br>exposure and protecting your skin from UV rays.<br><br>   SIGNS AND SYMPTONS<br><br>The signs and symptoms of actinic keratosis include:<br>Flat to slightly raised, scaly patches on the top layer of your skin<br>Lesions on your skin ranging in color from pink to red to brown,<br>orflesh-colored.<br>Patches or lesions caused by actinic keratosis usually are 1 inch or<br>less in diameter and primarily are found on areas exposed to the sun,<br>including your face, lips, ears, back of your hands, forearms, scalp<br>and neck.<br>There may be a single lesion or more. Later, lesions can develop a<br>hard, wart-like surface.<br>Symptoms may begin as soon as one hour after exposure and typically<br>reach their peak after one day.<br>Sun-damaged skin shows the following symptoms:<br> The skin appears dry, flaky and slightly more wrinkled than skin on<br>other parts of your body that have not been exposed to the sun. Dry<br>skin is also one of the most common causes of itching.<br>An actinic keratosis appears as a persistent patch of scaly (peeling)<br>skin that may have a jagged or even sharp surface<br>and that has a pink, yellow, red or brownish tint. At first, an<br>actinic keratosis is the size of a pimple.<br>Rarely, an actinic keratosis may itch or be slightly tender.<br>In most cases, your doctor can confirm that you have sun-damaged skin<br>simply by examining the area. Commonly, a biopsy is done to rule out<br>skin cancer in a patch of actinic keratosis.<br> In a biopsy, a small piece of skin is removed and examined in a laboratory.<br><br>To help detect actinic keratoses and other skin abnormalities in their<br>earliest stages, examine your entire skin surface thoroughly every one<br>to two months. Check for patches of discolored or scaly skin, moles,<br>small pearly nodules, sores and other skin abnormalities on all parts<br>of your body, including your scalp and genitals. Use a mirror to<br>inspect harder-to-see areas of your back, shoulders, upper arms,<br>buttocks and the soles of your feet. People who have multiple actinic<br>keratoses should have their skin checked by a doctor once a year.<br><br>Sun damage may result in a permanent cosmetic concern.<br>Most treatments for an actinic keratosis can leave a pale<br>(de-pigmented) area of the skin surface.<br>More important than appearance is the long-term impact of sun damage<br>on your chances of developing skin cancer. The more unprotected sun<br>exposure you have during your lifetime, the greater your risk of skin<br>cancer, especially if you have a light complexion.<br>Whereas Curaderm Treatment cannot leave you a scar or pale on your<br>skin because their penatrates through your<br>skin deeply and finally kills cancer cells without harming human cells.<br>Curaderm cream 20g contains the active anticancer  ingredent that<br>destroy sunspots cells because the high concentrations that assist BEC<br>to kill cancr cells.<br>For more information on this website feel free to click on this link<br>nomoreskincancer.info<br><br>

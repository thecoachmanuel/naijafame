If you've lived under working conditions that exposed you to asbestos, or had a household member that worked near or with asbestos, you should bring this to the attention of a medical doctor and seek free legal counsel.<br><br>What is Mesothelioma?<br><br>Chances are you may never have heard of mesothelioma cancer unless you or a relative have the disease.  Still considered as a rare cancer, it has been popularized by its linkage to asbestos.<br><br>Exactly what is mesothelioma cancer or malignant mesothelioma?  Malignant mesothelioma is a deadly cancer of the mesothelium, or lining of the lung and chest cavity.  However, it sometimes can be a deadly cancer of the peritoneum (the lining of the abdomen). It is almost always caused by exposure to asbestos, and is slow forming – often taking between 20-50 years to develop after exposure to asbestos.<br><br>Malignant Mesothelioma Symptoms<br><br>Symptoms of malignant mesothelioma in the lung and chest cavity are as follows:<br><br>- Shortness of breath<br>- Cough<br>- Weight Loss<br>- Chest Pain<br><br>Symptoms of malignant mesothelioma in the abdomen are as follows:<br><br>- Abdominal swelling and pain<br>- Weight Loss<br><br>Wondering How You Could Have Gotten Mesothelioma Cancer?<br><br>Several diseases are associated with exposure to asbestos.  They include:  malignant mesothelioma, asbestosis, pleural effusion, pleural plaques and thickening, and lung cancer.  <br>Prior to 1975 asbestos fibers were commonly used.  You could have been exposed to asbestos while working at any number of different industries.  Chief among the possibilities would be jobs at asbestos mining and milling plants, shipyards, fireproofing and heating, construction, automotive repair, insulation, pipefitting and boilermaking.<br><br>If you did not work in one of these industries or another that used asbestos, it is also possible that you could have been exposed if someone in your household worked with asbestos and carried asbestos fibers home on his or her clothing, hair or body.  You may also have been exposed indirectly by living near asbestos mines.<br><br>Although it is true that most patients with malignant mesothelioma, lung cancer or other asbestos-related diseases likely had prolonged exposure to asbestos over a long period of time, it is also possible for one to develop one of these diseases from a brief exposure to asbestos.<br><br>The odds of developing lung cancer from smoking also increases significantly from exposure to asbestos.  Although most people with lung cancer are told that their lung cancer was caused from smoking, if you or someone you know has lung cancer and also worked in an environment that gave you exposure to asbestos, it is highly recommended that you contact an attorney that specializes in handling mesothelioma and lung cancer cases caused by exposure to asbestos.  The justice system has been very generous in its rewards to people who suffer diseases caused by asbestos exposure.<br><br>To learn more about mesothelioma cancer I recommend you visit http://www.mesothelioma-cancer-online.com (Mesothelioma Cancer Online). when searching for web resources covering mesothelioma cancer.

              <p><i>Doctor pledges to raise over $20,000 for the Lance Armstrong Foundation. </i><br><br>
    	  			<p> July 25, 2004 -- Five-time Tour de France champion Lance Armstrong challenges cyclists across the world to help in the fight against cancer by joining the Peloton Project. Proceeds from the Peloton Project will benefit the Lance Armstrong Foundation (LAF), an organization dedicated to enhancing the quality of life of those living with, through, and beyond cancer.<br>
<br>
Founded in 1997, the LAF's mission is to enhance the quality of survival of those diagnosed with cancer. The LAF seeks to promote the optimal physical, psychological, and social recovery and care of cancer survivors and their loved ones. The Foundation focuses its activities in the following areas: survivor services and support, groundbreaking survivorship programs, and medical and scientific research grants.<br>
Rick Rosa, D.C. has pledged to raise over $20,000 for the Lance Armstrong Foundation as a member of the Peloton Project, a program where cyclists, cancer survivors and other volunteers raise funds and awareness for the Foundation in their local communities. <br>
<br>
With many people in his family suffering from the effects of cancer the last straw was drawn when his personal hero, his father was diagnosed with stage four colon cancer over two years ago he teamed up with LAF and the high end watch community to auction over $25,000 in watches ranging in price from $500 to $7950. Many of the finest watch makers like IWC, Panerai, Martin Braun, CYCLOS watch, Montana watch company, Ball watch company, David Yurman and Frederique constant came together Dr. Rosa. The auction will occur on  Timezone.com and will end on Saturday August 14th. <br>
<br>
The Peloton Project was established as a result of interest on the part of cyclists around the world who wished to join Lance Armstrong in his fight against cancer. In five years the project has raised over $9 million for the Foundation. Peloton Project members raise funds in their local communities and qualify for recognition awards, including an all-expense paid trip to the Ride for the Roses Weekend in Austin, Texas in October of 2004. <br>
<br>
The Ride for the Roses Weekend is among the most popular and significant events in the world of cycling. The annual event, held in Austin, Texas, attracts more than 6,500 participants in the 10- to 100-mile Ride for the Roses. Other events include: the Run for the Roses 5K fun run; the Health and Sport Expo; Post-Ride Party; and a variety of family-oriented events. In 2003 the event raised more than $4.5 million for the LAF's cancer survivorship programs and services<br>
<br>
By now, many people are aware of Lance Armstrong’s inspiring story. Diagnosed at age 25 with testicular cancer, Lance was given a less than 40 percent chance to live. The world-class cyclist faced enormous odds and uncertainty about his future, but from the moment of his diagnosis he declared himself a cancer survivor, not a cancer victim. He took an active role in educating himself about his disease. Armed with knowledge and confidence in medicine, he underwent aggressive treatment and beat the cancer.<br>
<br>
In 1999, the world witnessed one of the greatest comebacks in sports history when Lance won the Tour de France. In winning his fifth consecutive Tour victory in 2003, he again proved his superior strength—both as a cyclist and a cancer survivor.<br>

              <td align="left" height="12"><span class="style2">Since the late 1800’s, Asbestos has been widely used for commercial purposes and the usage dramatically increased during World War II. Thousands of Americans who work I in the ship yard; commercial plants etc were exposed to Asbestos dust. This was the beginning of Mesothelioma. The people who had a widespread exposure to Asbestos were at an increased risk of developing Mesothelioma. This was the beginning of the cursed disease.<br><br>Mesothelioma is the medical name for cancer of the pleura (the lining of the lung and chest cavity) or cancer of the peritoneum (the lining of the abdomen). Mesothelioma can be caused even due to an exposure to Asbestos for 1-2 months but it is most commonly found in those who had prolonged or persistent exposure.<br><br>Mesothelioma, generally does not affect a victim immediately after your exposure to Asbestos. Its affects usually appear 20-50 years after the exposure.  This long latency period is one main reason why the number of people suffering from Mesothelioma is increasing everyday, in spite of preventive measures taken by the government as well as individuals.<br><br>Very similar to other forms of cancer, Mesothelioma spreads rapidly, spreading not only throughout the pleura but also metastasizing to other internal organs. The common symptoms would include shortness of breath, chest pain, coughing and loss of weight.<br><br>Mesothelioma can be effectively countered by Oxygen treatment and reducing sugar consumption. Otto Warburg discovered that the main reason of cancer is replacement of normal oxygen respiration of the body's cells by an anaerobic [i.e., oxygen-deficient] cell respiration. Warburg’s theory helped us to understand that Cancer cells hate oxygen and that is the foundation of the modern oxygen treatment of cancer.<br><br>Another important information that we gathered from Warburg’s research is that Cancer cells metabolize through fermentation and fermentation requires sugar. Also, metabolism rate of a cancer cell is almost 8 times more than a normal cell. (Check how Mesothelioma works at Human anatomy animation-http://www.anatimaion.com ) This fact has been wisely used and concluded that reducing or stopping the intake of sugar can definitely work as an extremely useful deterrent to cancer growth.<br><br>The initial testing for Mesothelioma is done by X-rays and often followed by an open lung biopsy to confirm the test results. If diagnosed at an early stage the cancer can be removed surgically and full recovery can be achieved through regular chemotherapy and radiation treatment.<br><br>At an advanced stage, Mesothelioma is incurable; however, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and other pain relief treatments can relieve the patient comparatively and increase the life span. The period of survival depends on the stage at which the patient has been diagnosed for Mesothelioma and his general health conditions.<br>

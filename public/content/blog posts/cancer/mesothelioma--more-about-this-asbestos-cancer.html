              <td align="left" height="12"><span class="style2">Cancers and other forms of diseases are usually named <br>according to the part of the body or the internal organ <br>where abnormal growth of malignant cells takes place. <br>In the case of Mesothelioma, the abnormal cells grow in <br>the mesothelium, a surface cell layer that covers and <br>protects most internal organs. Normally, the <br>mesothelium produces small amount of fluid in order to <br>lubricate its layers—one of which directly covers the <br>organ—and allow the movement of the organs, like the <br>expansion and contraction of the lungs. A Mesothelioma <br>cancer patient’s mesothelium produces too much of this <br>lubricating fluid, thereby damaging nearby tissues and <br>organs. The most common form of Mesothelioma is Pleural <br>Mesothelioma, which begins in the Pleural or <br>Peritoneum, the membrane that lines the chest cavity <br>and covers the lungs. <br><br>About 2,000 cases of Mesothelioma have been noted <br>yearly in United States. This is still a rare disease <br>to consider, although the reported incidents have <br>escalated in the past two decades. It has been observed <br>and proven that heavy and long exposure to asbestos is <br>the prime cause of Mesothelioma. Asbestos is a group of <br>minerals in strong, flexible and fibrous form. It is <br>used in industrial products such as cement, brake <br>linings, textiles, electrical insulation, flooring <br>products, chemical filters, fireproofing materials and <br>others. This explains why most Mesothelioma patients <br>are working in construction sites, shipyards and <br>manufacturing companies of said industrial products. <br>Small asbestos particles float in the air and are <br>either inhaled or swallowed by workers or persons <br>within the vicinity. Aside from Mesothelioma, these <br>people can acquire asbestosis, a non-cancerous chronic <br>lung sickness and other forms of cancer of the lungs, <br>cancer of the larynx and kidney. <br><br>Asbestos-related Mesothelioma comprise only 70 to 80 <br>percent of the all the reported cases of the said <br>cancer. There are reported Mesothelioma cases wherein <br>the patients did not have any known exposure to <br>asbestos. Some have been exposed only for a short <br>period of time but still developed the cancer 20 to 50 <br>years after the exposure, like in the case of a <br>Mesothelioma cancer patient who only washed clothes <br>that have been exposed to asbestos. Likewise, asbestos <br>fibers that have been stuck in the hair strands of a <br>factory worker can also risk the health of others whom <br>he lives with. It is therefore important for workers <br>exposed to asbestos to change their clothes and take a <br>shower before leaving the workplace to prevent his <br>family members or companions from inhaling the asbestos <br>particles and thus, from acquiring Mesothelioma.   <br><br>The Mesothelioma cancer is slow-forming. That’s why one <br>develops the cancer so many years after the exposure to <br>asbestos. Some develop the cancer fifty years after the <br>exposure, which makes it hard to determine whether the <br>person has Mesothelioma or not, especially when the <br>patient has no knowledge of the exposure to asbestos. <br>Moreover, malignant Mesothelioma shows signs similar to <br>those of other ailments such as pneumonia. Symptoms of <br>Pleural Mesothelioma also evident in other illnesses <br>include: shortness of breath, persistence of cough, <br>weight loss and chest pain. Peritoneal Mesothelioma, <br>which affects the abdominal cavity, is indicated by <br>swelling of and pain in the abdomen, weight loss, bowel <br>obstruction, anemia, blood clotting abnormalities and <br>fever. <br><br>Complete physical examination is needed to make sure <br>one has Mesothelioma cancer. This includes xrays of the <br>body part where the symptoms are felt or seen, CT scan <br>and MRI. To confirm Mesothelioma, a biopsy is also <br>performed by a surgeon or oncologist (a physician who <br>is specializing in the diagnosis and treatment of a <br>cancer). The sample tissue removed by the surgeon is <br>examined by the pathologist. Once confirmed, the doctor <br>then finds out the extent of the cancer, which is <br>crucial to the treatment of Mesothelioma. Although <br>malignant, Mesothelioma when earlier diagnosed can <br>still be treated. Most Mesothelioma patients undergo <br>surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy.

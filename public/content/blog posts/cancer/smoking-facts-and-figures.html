Even if you are over 70 years of age. <br><br>Cigarette smoking increases the risk of having a heart attack by two or three times.<br><br>Every year 17,000 children under the age of five are admitted to hospital due to the effects of passive smoking. <br><br>Smoking causes at least 80% of all deaths from lung cancer.<br><br>Less than 10% of lung cancer patients survive five years.<br><br>83% of smokers say they would not smoke if they had their life again.<br><br>Teenage smokers experience more asthma and respiratory symptoms than non-smokers. <br><br>Chemicals that can be found in tobacco smoke:<br>Benzene - A poisonous gas found in petrol fumes.

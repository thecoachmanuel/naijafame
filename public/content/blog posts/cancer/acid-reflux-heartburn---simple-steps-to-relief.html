Are these claims realistic, or simply exaggerated to sell over<br>the counter medications? The fact is that doctors don't even agree on the causes, treatments,<br>and long-term risks related to heartburn, so you can believe what you want about the ads.<br><br>Heartburn is the uncomfortable feeling resulting from acid reflux, or GERD, gastroesophageal<br>reflux disease (try saying that out loud a few times). It can feel like a burning sensation<br>(hence, the name), but can also feel like pressure in the chest, which is why it is sometimes<br>confused with feelings associated with heart attacks.<br><br>Acid reflux occurs when the muscle between the stomach and the oesophagus gets weak or relaxes<br>at the wrong time. The result is that the stomach contents, including the acid, move up into<br>the oesophagus. Because the oesophagus doesn't have the protective lining that the stomach<br>does, the acid literally burns the oesophagus.<br><br>What Works? <br><br>Several non-prescription drugs may be effective for mild to moderate acid reflux,<br>such as antacids, which neutralize stomach acids. These include well-known over the counter<br>medications such as Tums and Rolaids. Another option is H2 receptor antagonists, which reduce<br>the production of stomach acids. These include Axid AR, Pepcid AC, Tagamet HB, and Zantac 75.<br>Pepcid complete is the only of these that combines an antacid with an H2 receptor antagonist.<br>Which is the best treatment? One study found that Pepcid complete performed better than either<br>an antacid alone or an H2 receptor antagonist alone.<br><br>Prescription drugs prescribed to treat acid reflux are called proton-pump inhibitors. These<br>include Aciphex, Nexium, Prevacid, Prilosec, and Protonix. While these are equally effective,<br>one study did find that Nexium may heal esophageal sores faster.<br><br>Homeopathic Remedies <br><br>Combined with homeopathic remedies, heartburn may be treated effectively<br>with less reliance on over the counter or prescription medications. Together, these solutions<br>may provide the answers where just one solution fails to deliver on the promise.<br><br>Natural options that may help reduce GERD include deglycyrrhizinated licorice (DGL), which may<br>bring fast relief and help heal damaged lining. Aloe Vera juice may also act quickly to bring<br>relief. For those with chronic problems, Gamma-oryzanol (rice bran oil) may be useful, as could<br>choline, pantothenic acid, and thiamin. These natural solutions may provide more effective<br>short-term relief as well as provide long-term dietary benefits.<br><br>Why Try a Homeopathic Remedy? <br><br>The benefits of natural solutions is that they are often less<br>costly and reduce the chances of becoming reliant on a particular solution. Natural solutions<br>include treating the cause as much as the affect, and experimenting with diet and alternative<br>treatments may help lessen the cause of the problem. Additionally, all of the homeopathic<br>remedies mentioned above can be used along with over the counter or prescription medications.<br><br>Does Acid Reflux Cause Cancer? <br><br>Studies on acid reflux and cancer vary. One study showed that<br>chronic acid reflux increased the chances of oesophageal cancer by as much as eight times.<br>Another study determined that the risk of cancer is not nearly as much as was once thought.<br>Chronic acid reflux can lead to Barrett's oesophagus, or BE, which has been thought to lead to<br>an increase in cancer. A study conducted by a group of medical doctors found that the risk of<br>cancer from BE is not as much as previously thought, stating that BE will not cause cancer for<br>most people.<br><br>What is not questioned is whether or not acid reflux is uncomfortable. Chronic GERD is<br>difficult to live with, and experimenting with both traditional medications and natural<br>remedies may be the best solution. As research continues on the causes and affects of GERD,<br>additional options are likely to come along.<br><br>____________________________________________________________<br><br>Andrew Kelly keeps you up to date on the latest Information & Strategies to help you control<br>your Acid Reflux/Heartburn.

              <td align="left"><span class="style2">*Winning* With Branding <br>by Laurie Rogers<br><br>If I were to ask you what K.D. was, you would undoubtedly <br>know it is a short form associated with Kraft Dinner. There<br>probably aren't many people who have not heard of "Kraft<br>Dinner" or who have not eaten it at one point in their life. In<br>fact, if I was to ask you to take a look in your cupboard now, <br>chances are, the majority of you would even have a box of <br>it in there! <br><br>If asked you who Eminem was, the chances are, you would<br>know who he was too. You may NOT exactly like him or his<br>music, but the fact is, you still know WHO he his. There's no<br>possible way you could miss hearing about him, as he is the<br>most talked about "BAD Boy Rapper" currently in the music <br>industry today. <br><br>Now, I am certainly not going to tell you to go out and break <br>the law to make yourself famous online. Because you want <br>to be able to actually spend all YOUR hard earned money!<br>Although branding yourself *effectively* consists of a lot of <br>work, it isn't worth that kind of fame. If you apply the correct <br>techniques it will not seem like much "work" at all! Now that <br>we have that covered I'm going to tell you, what has worked <br>for ME.<br><br>When I first became a publisher - I was "widely known" for<br>my "tell it like it is - attitude". In fact, if you were to go to my<br>site http://www.optinfrenzy.com/about.html and read all the <br>testimonials, that's exactly what you would read. My fellow <br>publishers loved the fact that I had the "guts" to tell people <br>what I really thought and because they liked my demeanor,<br>they would send me "referred subscribers" on a regular <br>basis. <br><br>Most people are familiar with me because I co-authored a <br>best selling ebook with Jimmy D. Brown, (Ezine Resource <br>Guide). But despite that there were a lot of people who still <br>had NO idea who I was. So, I began writing a lot of articles<br>on a VERY controversial subject - "SPAM", which in turn,<br>gave me the opportunity of becoming a "Featured Writer"<br>for one of the internet's most "prominent" ezines - DEMC.<br><br>If you want to WIN with Branding, this is what YOU need to do:<br><br>1.) Give people ONE thing that they can associate YOUR <br>name with. And as an eg., the VERY first thing that people <br>see in my signature file is - Laurie Rogers is the Co-Author <br>of Ezine Resource Guide. Hundreds, if NOT thousands of <br>people own that book, so when people read it, they know <br>right off the bat, WHO I AM.<br><br>2.) Don't be afraid to step outside YOUR comfort zone at<br>times to get "KNOWN". Write about popular topics, BUT<br>use a different approach than other people do. Compare<br>topics to applicable scenarios that you see in "real life", <br>just as I did above with "Kraft Dinner and Eminem". Make<br>your article one to REMEMBER!<br><br>3.) Express YOUR TRUE feelings to your audience and be<br>YOURSELF, you will get more referrals and RESPECT for <br>it in the long run. <br><br>3.) Be CONSISTENT! Just as it does with everything else,<br>being consistent PAYS OFF in the long run. This is exactly <br>where people FAIL because they are NOT consistent with<br>their efforts. They don't advertise on a regular basis, which<br>means LESS sales - Branding works the exact same way,<br>the more promotion you do, the more recognition you will<br>receive. <br><br>By using the techniques above, YOU can easily WIN with<br>BRANDING - I guarantee it.

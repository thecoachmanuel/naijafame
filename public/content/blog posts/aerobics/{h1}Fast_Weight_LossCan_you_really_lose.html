              <td align="left"><span class="style2"> Is it better to lose 2lbs a day or 2lbs a week?<br><br>Yes it’s very possible that you can lose 60lbs in 30 days but I don’t think you would want to and here’s the reason why:<br><br>Let’s say you do lose 60lbs in 30 days… how much of that weight you lose do you think is going to be pure body fat? Remember-- body fat makes us look ugly. <br><br>Anytime you try to lose more than 2lbs a week or 60lbs in 30 days (2lbs a day!)…A larger part of the weight you lose is only going to be water and muscle. Losing a lot of water and muscle weight does nothing to improve your looks and it slows down your metabolism<br><br>Slow metabolism = easier weight gain<br><br>Every time you see a weight loss ad that’s too good to be true…the ad is basically saying “Hey you can lose 60lbs in 30 days but some of that weight you lose is going to be water and muscle weight”<br><br>Whenever you are trying to lose weight (body fat) for good and look your very best you definitely do not want to lose any muscle. Every time you lose muscle your metabolism slows down. A slower metabolism makes it easier for you to gain weight<br><br>As a matter of fact you may be one of those people who gain weight just by looking at food. The reason for your easy weight gain is that you probably don’t have that much muscle to begin with and when you try to lose 60lbs overnight you are only going to lose more muscle making it very easy for to gain all the weight back you just lost!<br><br>The more muscle you have the better you look. Even if you had two people of the same height & weight but both had different amounts of muscle in their bodies--the person who has the most muscle will always look better.<br><br>Are the outrageous claims that the weight loss ads make true? Can you lose 60lbs in 30 days or 10lbs overnight? The answer isn’t No but a big Maybe. <br><br>But if you do happen to lose 60lbs in 30 days you’re only going to look worse (because of the muscle you lose) and you’re going to gain it all back quicker than you lost it (because you’re metabolism is slower now that you lost muscle)<br><br>What if you have to lose 10lbs in one week to pass a physical exam? In this case you may have no choice but to go on “Dr. whoever’s rice cake diet” to lose 10lbs in a week. All you’re looking for in that situation is a quick fix to your weight loss problem. <br><br>But if you want to lose weight for good, look your best, & keep your metabolism burning at a steady rate… You got to lose weight at a much slower rate. <br><br>You want to try to lose no more than 2lbs a week or 3lbs at the most when you want to lose weight permanently. Usually when you lose anything over 2lbs a week you are only losing water and muscle weight which again has no effect on long-term weight loss or significantly improving the way you look.<br><br>Losing 2lbs a week is a lot simpler than trying to lose 10lbs a week. One of the things you can do to start losing 2lbs a week is to substitute higher calorie foods you eat with lower calorie foods. <br><br>For example a simple trick that I have most of my clients do is to replace all the sodas and juices they drink with water. The drinking water trick is taken very lightly by a lot of people---but many of my clients tell me that they see a difference in their weight after drinking only water for a couple of weeks.<br><br>The other thing you can do is to increase your daily physically activity. This doesn’t mean that you have to start signing up for marathons regularly. To gradually increase your physical activity you can--<br><br>* Park in the back of parking lots so you have to walk more to your destination<br>* You can take the stairs instead of the elevator—it doesn’t have to be all the flights…walk some flights and take the elevator the rest of the way.<br>* Play golf or play with your kids everyday<br><br>The point is to just do something…It doesn’t have to a lot at first but after about a couple weeks start to take 20-30minitue walks in the park or ride a bicycle everyday. <br><br>Long-term weight loss doesn’t happen in 60 days or overnight… it happens in the Long-term. Just remember that the next time you see a weight loss ad that promises you unbelievable results.<br><br><br><p> About the Author

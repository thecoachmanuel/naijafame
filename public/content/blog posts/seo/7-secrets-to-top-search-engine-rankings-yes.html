I'll reveal the <br>'secrets' soon.<br><br>While I'm far from being an SEO (Search <br>Engine Optimization) expert and am just <br>sharing experiences here, I've achieved <br>some phenomenal results by following these <br>basic rules and without resorting to <br>'tricks'.  Importantly, these are rankings <br>that last.<br><br>- side note -<br><br>I'm not suggesting you shouldn't learn <br>about SEO or use genuine software that <br>helps, in fact you should.<br><br>To learn about SEO, some sites you can <br>check out:<br><br>http://www.selfpromotion.com : shows you <br>how to construct your webpages and submit <br>them to hundreds of search engines and <br>directories absolutely FREE.<br><br>http://www.searchenginewatch.com : <br>everything you need to know related to <br>search engines.<br><br>For software to facilitate your website <br>positioning, this one's the best: <br>http://www.turnkeymoney.com/te.htm<br><br>- end side note -<br><br>For example (at this time of writing), here <br>are my rankings for <br>http://www.Marketing-Make-Money.com in <br>Yahoo alone (remember these are extremely <br>competitive keywords):<br><br>'Make money online' | rank: #1 of 33.9 <br>million sites Proof: <br>http://tinyurl.com/2wtr9<br><br>'Make money' | rank: #27 of 85.4 million <br>sites Proof: http://tinyurl.com/35cc3<br><br>'Web marketing' | rank: #4 of 113 million <br>sites Proof: http://tinyurl.com/yv8de<br><br>'Web marketing tips' | rank: #6 of 10.2 <br>million sites Proof: <br>http://tinyurl.com/388a6<br><br>How did I achieve such incredible rankings <br>without being some SEO guru or even <br>obsessively optimizing my site?<br><br>Recall the number one rule? It's to help <br>the search engines provide relevant search <br>results.<br><br>Now I honestly believe there are only two <br>MAIN things which support this rule and in <br>the process, reward your website with the <br>high rankings you desire.<br><br>These two things are Keyword Rich Content <br>and Targeted Back Links which we'll talk <br>about later...<br><br>Here then are 7 powerful secrets you can <br>use to model your website after to explode <br>your high search engine rankings!<br><br>Step 1: Determine Highly Searched Keywords<br><br>Determine highly searched and targeted <br>keywords/keyword phrases related to your <br>site and put them into a list.  Here're the <br>tools to use:<br><br>http://instantmarketingsecrets.com/keyword.htm : compares results of keyword searches <br>from Overture and Wordtracker and displays <br>them side by side.<br><br>http://smtek.info/cgi-bin/keywordtool.cgi : <br>allows you to find relevant hot keywords <br>with a single click...very cool very useful.<br><br>http://www.goodkeywords.com : excellent <br>software to find targeted keywords in <br>Overture and various other engines.<br><br>Step 2: Register Keyword Rich Domain Names<br><br>While there've been contrasting arguments <br>about whether having keywords in your <br>domain helps, I strongly feel it does. The <br>same goes for dashes between words in the <br>domain. <br><br>Use these to source for domain name ideas:<br> <br>http://www.nameboy.com<br>http://www.deleteddomains.com<br><br>You can also register your domains for <br>peanuts per year here:<br><br>http://www.namecheap.com<br>http://www.registerfly.com<br><br>Step 3: Use Your Targeted Keywords In Your Copy<br><br>Use the list of keywords in step 1 within <br>your website copy, especially in the title, <br>headline and first paragraph. The important <br>thing is to make them flow smoothly within <br>the context of the copy so prospects will <br>not find it weird.<br><br>Step 4: Insert Keyword Rich Relevant Content<br><br>Next, build up your site's content with <br>relevant topics containing your keywords.  <br>Don't worry, here are some ways to get <br>instant content:<br><br>- Posting suitable articles that contain <br>your keywords.  These can either be your <br>own or from article directories like <br>http://www.ezinearticle.com , <br>http://www.goarticles.com or <br>http://webpronews.com<br><br>- Posting newsletter issues in an archive <br>online if you write any<br><br>- Do reviews and commentaries on related <br>products and services in your market as <br>content <br><br>Step 5: Aggressively Acquire Targeted Back Links<br><br>This is the second most important (some say <br>it's the first) factor to note after <br>targeted and relevant content.<br><br>Get as many good quality incoming links <br>from other sites as you can, believe me, <br>this will really make a huge difference to <br>your rankings. These links should come from <br>sites in your market and preferably those<br>with high PageRanks of 5 and above.<br><br>Use http://www.webmasterbrain.com/prog/ to<br>search for sites with top rankings in <br>Google for your specified keyword/keyword <br>phrases. It also reveals their individual <br>PageRanks next to their listings.<br><br>An excellent resource to check PageRank can <br>also be found at http://rankwhere.com.<br><br>Alternatively, you can download Alexa <br>toolbar from http://ww.alexa.com as it also <br>shows Alexa traffic ranking for any site. <br>This is very useful for seeking high <br>traffic link partners.<br><br>If you are looking for mind-blowing linking <br>strategies and tricks, the best guide I've <br>ever seen must be "Power Linking 2: <br>Evolution" at:<br>http://www.turnkeymoney.com/powerlink.htm<br><br>Step 6: Hand Submit Your Site To The Top <br>Directories and Search Engines<br><br>There's no point in using those 'submit to <br>millions' services as only a few search <br>engines really matter.<br><br>Using those services may actually cause <br>your site to be penalized by these major <br>engines.<br><br>In fact if you've done enough important <br>reciprocal linkings, you don't even need to <br>submit your sites as spiders which crawl <br>your link partner sites (already indexed) <br>will pick up your link easily.<br><br>However, if you must submit, do it by hand <br>at these directories and search engines <br>here:<br><br>Ask Jeeves: http://tinyurl.com/467y<br>LookSmart/Zeal: http://tinyurl.com/2uzan<br>Mama: http://tinyurl.com/38gdb<br>Open Directory: http://tinyurl.com/2jk82<br>Google: http://tinyurl.com/hlzz<br>Yahoo: http://tinyurl.com/fq32<br>All The Web: http://tinyurl.com/2hq24<br>Inktomi: http://tinyurl.com/26cgu<br><br>Step 7: Tune Your Site For Maximum Optimization<br><br>The final step would be to constantly <br>monitor and analyze your website traffic <br>against rankings. This is so you can review <br>and tweak for further improvement in your <br>rankings.<br><br>I hope this article will prove highly <br>useful to you. Do not be scare away by SEO, <br>it's simple once you follow the above <br>system. While these steps are not <br>everything you can do, it'll be enough to <br>get your site ranked very well for the <br>targeted keywords you chose.<br><br>Again, remember the number one rule of <br>giving relevant content and establishing <br>good back links. Help the search engines <br>provide relevant results for their <br>customers and your rankings will <br>automatically skyrocket to the top!

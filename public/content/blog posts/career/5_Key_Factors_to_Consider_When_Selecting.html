              <td align="left"><span class="style2">With today's economy, more and more companies are finding themselves <br>faced with the situation of having to reduce headcount to remain <br>competitive. Here are five key factors to consider when selecting <br>an outplacement firm if your company is ever faced with a workforce <br>reduction.<br><br>1. Types of Services Provided. <br><br>One decision you will need to make regarding outplacement is whether <br>your displaced workers would benefit most from group or individual <br>one-on-one outplacement. For the majority of outplaced employees, <br>if your budget permits, individual outplacement is the preferred <br>option since it provides one-on-one support that will help them move <br>forward more quickly than they would on their own.<br><br>If you decide they would benefit most from individual outplacement, <br>you will then need to determine what services would be most valuable<br>to your displaced employees. One option would be to select an <br>outplacement firm that develops their resume and cover letter for them. <br>Another option would be an outplacement firm that offers office space <br>and a computer for the displaced worker to prepare their own job <br>search materials.<br> <br>2. Areas of Specialty. <br><br>Another factor to consider when selecting an outplacement firm is<br>whether it is important to you that they have experience working with<br>the type of displaced employees you will be sending them. A related <br>factor is whether it is important to you that the outplacement company <br>specializes in dealing with companies like yours. <br><br>If their areas of specialty are important to you, review the<br>outplacement company's web site and other marketing materials to see <br>what their specialty is or ask them directly. If an outplacement <br>firm's expertise lies in serving large companies displacing <br>administrative staff and your small business is displacing experienced <br>managers, this outplacement firm may not be the best fit for you. <br><br>3. Experience with Current Job Search Practices.<br><br>How important is it to you that the outplacement firm be experienced<br>with Internet job search techniques? Is it likely that the Internet<br>will play a key role in your displaced employees' job search strategy?<br><br>If you determine that Internet savvy is an important evaluation point<br>for an outplacement firm, check to see whether the outplacement firm <br>recognizes the importance of the Internet by having a web site. Are <br>they aware of the top online career sites? Do they offer a service to <br>post displaced employees resumes on these top online career sites? <br>Do they have the ability to distribution resumes electronically to a <br>select group of employers and recruiters?<br> <br>4. Length of Time Support is Provided.<br><br>Another factor to consider when selecting outplacement services is the <br>amount of time you feel the displaced worker would require outplacement <br>support. In general, the more senior-level the position, the longer it <br>will take the displaced employee to find suitable employment. <br><br>A second time factor to consider is whether the displaced worker will<br>receive ongoing one-on-one scheduled sessions with a career transition<br>consultant or whether the ongoing support merely includes access to job<br>search support materials. <br> <br>5. Costs. <br><br>Outplacement costs must be considered when selecting an outplacement<br>firm. Check to see whether outplacement costs are clearly defined and<br>stated on the outplacement firm's web site and in their marketing <br>materials. Are you charged only if the displaced employee elects to <br>contact the outplacement firm for support or are you charged regardless <br>of whether the displaced employee receives support? Are there <br>affordable packages available that provide the services you feel your <br>displaced employees would most benefit from without providing unwanted <br>services? <br><br>Another cost factor to consider is whether the outplacement firm gives<br>you the able to select outplacement services a la carte to meet your <br>needs. Also determine whether the outplacement company has a minimum <br>fee requirement or whether they will charge you only for the number of <br>displaced employees you actually have even if the number is as few as<br>one. <br><br>By considering each of these five factors you can develop effective<br>selection criteria for deciding on an outplacement provider to best<br>meet the needs of your displaced employees while adhering to your<br>budget constraints.<br><p> About the Author

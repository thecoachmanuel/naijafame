              <td align="left"><span class="style2">No doubt you’ve heard of the 80/20 rule – which states that<br>20 percent of affiliates generate 80% of affiliate income, and<br>conversely, remaining 80 percent of affiliates generate only<br>20 percent of all income for most affiliate programs.<br><br>There are ten basics that will put your affiliate marketing<br>in the top 20 percent of affiliate earnings. Ten suggestions<br>that will transform your affiliate income from a trickling<br>creek that barely covers your hosting fees, to a roaring river<br>of extra disposable income.<br><br>TOP AFFILIATE MARKETERS DO MOST OF THESE TEN ITEMS<br><br>1.Top affiliate marketers cloak web site links<br><br>Cloaking affiliate links should not be necessary, but is. Oddly<br>many site visitors refuse to visit your links if they see an<br>affiliate code appended to the URL when they hover their mouse<br>over a link on your web page. Sometimes they will type the<br>affiliate domain directly to the browser address bar while<br>removing your affiliate ID from the URL. To short circuit this<br>odd behavior, simply cloak the URL. How? Visit this Link Tool:<br>http://WebpositionAdvisor.com/tools/link_cloaker.php<br><br>2.Top affiliate marketers write & distribute articles<br><br>Writing articles about your market niche is essential to gain<br>reputation as an expert in your field. But the biggest benefit<br>comes not just from writing those articles, but from having<br>those articles published by other web site owners and ezine<br>publishers. Your article gains you both reputation and links<br>from other web sites from the resource box appended to the<br>end of each article. Here are major article distribution sites.<br>http://yahoogroups.com/group/free-content/<br>http://groups.yahoo.com/group/aabusiness/<br>http://www.goarticles.com<br>http://www.ideamarketers.com<br><br>3.Top affiliate marketers focus on a market niche<br><br>Filling a web site with content reflecting a narrowly focused<br>product or service niche is a well known method of gaining web<br>traffic in your area of specialty. An excellent resource that<br>can help you determine relevant and focused areas to fill your<br>site with is called NicheBot. They offer innovative tools to<br>research and pinpoint market niches for your web site based on<br>the WordTracker Database and Google.<br>http://www.nichebot.com<br><br>4.Top affiliate marketers use autoresponder series<br><br>Autoresponders are incredibly valuable tools that allow you to<br>send a timed series of email messages to those that sign up for<br>them. Most often those autoresponders are sent through a third<br>party provider. Some of the top providers are Sendfree.com and<br>aweber.com, for a tutorial covering autoresponder basics, visit:<br>http://website101.com/email_e-mail/email_autoresponder_basics.html<br><br>5.Top affiliate marketers create web pages to pre-sell<br><br>Creating either testimonial pages or review pages that discuss<br>and pre-sell the product or service you are affiliated with is<br>the best method of getting increased orders for your chosen<br>affiliate programs. Many programs actually provide either an<br>article or recommended text to sell their products for you and<br>allow reproduction of those articles with your links embedded.<br><br>6.Top affiliate marketers gather email addresses<br><br>The best affiliates collect email addresses on their web site<br>by offering free reports via the above mentioned autoresponders<br>or by giving away ebooks or through newsletter signup forms.<br>The best use all of these methods or more to build their list<br>of email addresses. This also allows you to contact potential<br>customers that would otherwise never see your site again after<br>clicking away to the affiliate program web site. <br><br>7.Top affiliate marketers advertise SOMEWHERE<br><br>Depending on your market niche you should advertise using PPC<br>and/or ezine advertising. Some categories of Pay-per-click can<br>be prohibitively expensive, but advertising somewhere is all<br>but mandatory to gain substantial additional traffic to your<br>site. There are some great bargains in ezine advertising and<br>some less popular PPC engines other than Yahoo’s Overture and<br>Google’s Adwords. Try 7search, Kanoodle and FindWhat for lower<br>Bids than the big boys of PPC.<br><br>8.Top affiliate marketers optimize for search engines<br><br>Search engine optimization is becoming more complex as more<br>and more webmasters participate, but the basics applied to<br>your site can increase visibility dramatically over time. The<br>most critical of the many SEO techniques is to use title tags<br>that reflect individual PAGE content. Many webmasters write a<br>master title tag and apply that site-wide. This is the worst<br>thing you could do for search engine ranking. Learn more SEO:<br>http://SearchEngineOptimism.com/SEO_Tutorial/<br><br>9.Top affiliate marketers give away ebooks or freebies<br><br>Everyone knows by now that giving something away is a great<br>traffic generator and allows you to gather email addresses<br>to allow contact of potential customers at a later date. This<br>strategy is employed by EVERY successful web-based company at<br>one time or another. Think of all the free things YOU have<br>collected online over time. Screensavers, software, ebooks,<br>discount codes, toolbars, white papers. They work!<br><br>10. Top Affiliate marketers have their own mailing lists<br><br>The best of affiliate marketers have their own newsletter or<br>ezine and gather email addresses on their site to build their<br>list of subscribers. Having this list allows regular contact<br>with potential customers interested in your site, your product<br>and your market niche. If you don’t write your own material or<br>think you can’t produce weekly content, there are hundreds of<br>authors out there that will gladly product articles for you.<br>The article distribution lists provide free content and ghost<br>Writers provide high quality content for a fee. <br><br>If you implement ALL the above techniques, you are guaranteed<br>to become one of the top affiliate marketers on the web. Then<br>you can create your own product telling everyone how YOU did<br>it, create your own affiliate program and have hundreds of us<br>selling for you.<br><br><p> About the Author

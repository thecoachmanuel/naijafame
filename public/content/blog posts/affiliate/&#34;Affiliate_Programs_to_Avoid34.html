              <td align="left"><span class="style2">Affiliate Programs to Avoid <br><br>Copyright 2003 (c) Rosalind Gardner, All Rights Reserved.<br><br>As an affiliate marketer of Internet dating services, I'm always on <br>the lookout for good quality dating sites and products to offer my <br>single visitors. Merchants help me out when they let me know <br>about their new products and affiliate programs. <br><br>I was therefore thrilled when one of my friendly affiliate competitors <br>got in touch to tell me that he'd started his own Internet dating <br>service and affiliate program. <br><br>Having launched a community membership site myself last year, <br>I could fully appreciate the huge amount of time and money my <br>friend had invested to develop this new site. He was justifiably <br>proud of his accomplishment and I was excited by the prospect <br>of having a product to promote that would benefit everyone - <br>my customers, my friend and myself. <br><br>Unfortunately, it didn't quite work out that way. <br><br>The first stumbling block was the low commission he offered. His <br>top rate was 30%, with no commissions on recurring sales. <br><br>This puzzled me. As an affiliate marketer of dating programs, he <br>should have been aware that new sites offer at least 50% on <br>new and recurring sales to entice good affiliates to sign up. If <br>commissions on recurring sales are not offered, then the rates on <br>new sales should be increased to between 70 and 100 percent. <br><br>In most cases, his affiliate program would have struck out for me <br>at that point. However, as this was my friend's site, it occurred to <br>me that perhaps his product was so unique that the potential for <br>high volume sales might offset the lower commission. Hoping for <br>the best, I continued my review.<br><br>When I got to the site, the first thing I noticed was '6 registered <br>members' prominently displayed at the top of the homepage. <br>That normally wouldn't be a problem, except for the fact that my <br>customers are looking for friends and soul mates. If I send them <br>to a site where there are only six people to meet, they'll likely be <br>disappointed. Worse, by wasting their time, they lose trust in my <br>judgement and then I will lose them as customers.<br><br>That's not good. My customers are literally my bread and butter. <br>Giving them what they want and expect is how I stay in business. <br>Paying for traffic that I send to a merchant site where there is <br>nothing to buy, will put me out of business. <br><br>(This is how a membership site should be structured. When <br>starting a dating service, the merchant pays for advertising to <br>bring people to their site. To entice visitors to sign up as members, <br>he will initially offer his services for fr*ee. When the database is <br>large enough to attract paying customers, the affiliate program <br>manager then invites potential affiliates to join their program.)<br><br>Although my friend's program had already struck out for my customers <br>and me, I was still curious, so I kept on looking. <br><br>Next I clicked on a link labeled 'Dating Resources'. Expecting to find <br>Internet dating tips and advice, I found links and banners pointing <br>to Lavalife, FriendFinder and other affiliated dating sites instead. <br>When I asked him about placing affiliate programs on his site, my <br>friend said he simply wanted to supplement his income until the <br>dating service got *rolling*. I can understand his motivation. However, <br>what he doesn't understand is the concept of customer 'hijacking'. <br><br>As an affiliate, you pay good money to get visitors to your site. You <br>presell your merchants' products and expect the merchant to honor <br>their end of the bargain by making the sale and sending your <br>commission check. You don't pay for the merchant to send YOUR <br>customers to THEIR affiliated merchants.<br><br>I didn't need to look any further. I told my friend that I would hold <br>off on signing up and why. Fortunately, he understood and has already <br>alleviated some of the problems I mentioned. <br><br>Knowing when NOT to sign up for an affiliate program can sometimes <br>be a tough call. However, you can simplify the process considerably. <br>Put yourself inside your customer's head. If the product won't work <br>for them, the program strikes out. Simple as that.

Recently introduced techniques make it easy to take advantage of this capability.<p><p>In the past, web audio was primarily decorative, consisting of musical fanfares or other clichéd sound effects. Now, you can use audio to multiply the impact of your message and create stronger bonds with your visitors.<p><p>Audio’s power comes from its ability to engage more of your visitor’s senses. The more senses you engage, the easier it will be to effectively communicate. Instead of just reading your words and looking at your picture, you can communicate with your voice – and the voices of your clients.<p><p>The power of audio can be appreciated by comparing the newspaper column version of Tom and Ray Magliozzi’s Car Talk with the program aired each week on National Public Radio. Although the newspaper column and radio program address the same topics, it’s far more fun to listen to Car Talk – where you can experience Tom and Ray’s intonations and phrasing – than to read the same words.<p><p>Here are some of the ways you can employ audio on your website:<p><ul><p>	<p><li>Welcoming messages. You can create closer emotional bonds with website visitors by personally welcoming them to your site and introducing some of the features they should explore.<p>	<p><li>Testimonials. Audio testimonials are far more powerful that written testimonials, especially if you include a photograph of the individual speaking the testimonial. The next best thing to a face-to-face referral is a recording of a client explaining their satisfaction with your product in their own words.<p>	<p><li>Guarantees. Your satisfaction guarantees gain impact when you deliver them in your own voice. Place them on your order form, at the point of sale. People are inherently cautious about ordering products and services from the Internet. Reassure them that their credit card and personal information are safe with you.<p>	<p><li>Seminars and teleconferences. Short excerpts about upcoming events can make your event even more appealing. Snippets from past seminars can whet visitors’ appetites for more.<p>	<p><li>Tips. Add interest to your site by describing an audio ‘tip of the day’ or ‘tip of the week’ in your own words. Be sure to offer access to previous tips, too.<p>	<p><li>Audio postcards. You can include audio invitations and testimonials as links in email sent to clients and prospects. To arrange an audio testimonial, simply provide your client with a phone number and password, and invite them to call up and express their satisfaction with their purchase from you. Audio postcards are a great way to stay in contact with your clients and prospects with an announcement of an upcoming product or service. They are also a quick way to acknowledge a special occasion. <p>	<p><li>Streaming audio can be used to allow visitors to playback longer events, like seminars or teleconferences.<p></ul><p><p>When you add audio to your website, allow your visitors to maintain control. Don’t begin playing your message when the webpage loads. Instead, invite visitors to ‘click here’ to hear your voice. Keep your messages as short and concise as possible.<p><p>And avoid ‘scripting’ your introductions and guarantees. Write down the key ideas you want to communicate, but deliver them in your own words as conversationally as possible.<p><p>Web audio is no longer a futuristic luxury. Web audio is here now and it’s as close as your telephone. It is an affordable and easily added feature that can set you apart from the competition and help communicate your message with added impact.<p><p><p><p><p>

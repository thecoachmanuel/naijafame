A Technical Introduction to Audio Cables<br><br>What is so important about cables anyway?<br><br>One of the most common questions asked by consumers faced <br>with purchasing cables for their audio or home theater <br>system is, “What is so important about cables anyway?” They <br>can cost as much or more than some of the hardware in the <br>system and to many it is difficult to understand why wire <br>isn’t just wire. <br><br>To begin to understand how audio cables work, we have to <br>start with the two fundamentally different types of audio <br>cables you are likely to have in your system. The first type <br>of cable is called an interconnect, which is used to connect <br>various components together (such as a CD player to a <br>receiver). The second type of cable is called the <br>loudspeaker cable (this is the wire going from the receiver <br>or amplifier to the speakers). It is important to realize <br>that both types of cables are carrying the same information, <br>just with different amounts of energy. <br><br>Interconnects carry a signal with very little energy. These <br>cables only need just enough energy to convey the <br>information from the source, for example a CD player, to the <br>amplifier. The low energy requirement means that the signal <br>in interconnects has very little current (usually in the <br>range of thousandths of an amp). <br><br>Loudspeaker cables on the other hand, carry a large amount <br>of energy. All of the energy required to move the speaker <br>cones and make sound must come through the loudspeaker <br>cables. Because of the high-energy requirement in these <br>cables the current is relatively high (currents can reach 10 <br>amps or more). <br><br>The very basic reason why audio cables are important is <br>because they change the signal going through them. There are <br>two different, fundamental ways that an audio cable can <br>change the signal. The cable itself can change the signal, <br>or the cable can allow outside sources of energy to change <br>the signal. <br><br>In order to understand how these two situations can occur, <br>some basic background electrical knowledge is needed. <br><br>Signals in all types of wires are conveyed by the <br>combination of voltage and current. Every signal has some <br>amount of voltage and some amount of current. The larger the <br>difference in voltage between two places, say the beginning <br>and the end of a cable, the larger the amount of current, <br>and vice-versa. The direct analogy to voltage and current is <br>the flow of water through a hose. The amount of water <br>flowing through the hose is analogous to current. The water <br>pressure in the hose is analogous to voltage. The higher the <br>amount of water pressure, the more water will flow through <br>the hose. The higher the amount of voltage, the more current <br>will flow through the wire. <br><br>Every cable has a set of electrical properties that can be <br>measured using standard electrical testing equipment. The <br>three most basic properties are resistance, capacitance and <br>inductance. While a detailed description of these three <br>different electrical properties is outside the scope of this <br>article, a basic description of the relevant effects of <br>these three properties can be given. <br><br>- Resistance opposes current. The higher the resistance the <br>greater the amount of energy that is removed from the current <br>and turned into heat. <br><br>- Capacitance opposes changes in voltage. If a voltage is <br>increasing, capacitance will cause the voltage to increase <br>more slowly. If a voltage is decreasing, capacitance will <br>cause the voltage to decrease more slowly.<br><br>- Inductance opposes changes in current. If current is <br>increasing, inductance will cause the current to increase <br>more slowly. If current is decreasing, inductance will cause<br>the current to decrease more slowly. <br><br>The final piece of background knowledge that is needed for <br>this article is what the audio signal looks like. If one <br>were to take the speaker cover off a speaker to look at the <br>speaker cone while music is playing, you would see that it <br>is moving back and forth. In order to move the speaker cone <br>back and forth, the electrical signal must push and then <br>pull the cone in rapid and repeating fashion. This is <br>accomplished by having an Alternating Current, or AC.<br> <br>Alternating Current simply means that the voltage oscillates <br>between positive and negative. Because the voltage drives <br>the current, this means that the current also goes positive <br>and negative. In other words, the current is going back and <br>forth in the wire, just like the speaker cone. The subtle <br>variations in how fast the voltage and current go back and <br>forth creates the different sounds that we hear when <br>listening to music. <br><br>How a cable itself affects the audio signal<br><br>Now, going back to the ways that the cable itself can change <br>the signal going through it, let’s consider both types of <br>cables separately. <br><br>As stated previously, interconnect cables carry a very small <br>amount of current. Relative to the current the voltage is <br>large. Because of that fact, capacitance is important, but <br>inductance is relatively unimportant. As the voltage <br>oscillates between being positive and negative, the <br>capacitance slows the voltage changes down, and causes <br>delays. This can cause audible distortion in the sound. <br>Because interconnects have very little current, resistance <br>is not much of a factor. Even an interconnect with extremely <br>high resistance will only remove an infinitesimally small <br>amount of energy. <br><br>The signal in loudspeaker cables is essentially the opposite <br>of the signal in interconnects. Both cables have the same <br>information, but in loudspeaker cables, the voltage is small <br>and the current is large, relatively speaking. Because of <br>the high current, both resistance and inductance are <br>important in loudspeaker cables. The higher the resistance, <br>the greater the amount of energy that will be absorbed by <br>the cables. The resistance will not cause any distortion, <br>but it will decrease the volume of the sound. The inductance <br>on the other hand, can cause distortion. As the current <br>oscillates between being positive and negative, the <br>inductance slows the current changes down, and causes <br>delays. <br><br>How a cable lets outside sources of energy affect the signal<br><br>As stated previously, the second fundamental way of altering <br>a signal passing through an audio cable is to introduce <br>outside sources of energy. This outside energy is typically <br>termed “noise”. By definition, if any energy is absorbed by <br>the signal, the signal has been distorted. <br><br>There are many potential sources of noise around audio <br>cables. Some of the more common sources of noise, such as <br>radio frequency waves, are familiar to most people. When <br>wiring up a radio, frequently a consumer must attach an <br>antenna. Antennae are intentionally designed to channel <br>radio frequency energy into a stereo. Just like an antenna, <br>it is entirely possible for an audio cable to pick up radio <br>frequency energy. If you are not intending to listen to the <br>radio, this is not a welcome effect. <br> <br>Electronic components, electrical cords, sound waves, and <br>even the sun, are all capable of creating noise. Electrical <br>cords create electromagnetic fields around them that can <br>transfer energy to a cable. Sound waves create mechanical <br>vibrations that can be transformed into electrical energy <br>that is added to an audio signal. Because there are so many <br>different types of noise, there are many methods used to <br>prevent a cable from picking up noise. Shielding, twisting <br>of conductors, and mechanical damping are all common noise <br>protection methods in cables. <br><br>While noise affects both interconnects and loudspeaker <br>cables, generally the effects are far more significant in <br>interconnects. This is because the signals in the <br>interconnects have far less energy. Since most forms of <br>noise are inherently low energy to begin with, this means <br>that it is far easier for them to modify the low energy <br>interconnect signals than the high-energy loudspeaker cable <br>signals. <br><br>Macro vs. Micro<br><br>The parameters discussed so far have been primarily “macro” <br>effects. These are for the most part the top-level <br>parameters that effect cables. These parameters as well as <br>others not discussed here also exist at a “micro” level. <br>Taking capacitance as an example, a given cable will have an <br>overall capacitance that can be measured. This overall <br>capacitance is a “macro” level parameter. The same cable can <br>also be analyzed as 1000 separate but connected pieces. Each <br>piece will have a local capacitance. These local parameters <br>are “micro” effects and can have their own impact on the <br>signal separate from the “macro” effects. <br><br>The impact that the “micro” level parameters have on an <br>audio signal is usually less than the impact of the “macro” <br>level parameters. However, they do still make a difference <br>in the signal transfer. The various ways that audio <br>companies choose to either mitigate or ignore these “micro” <br>level details is, in part, responsible for the vast array of <br>different cable designs. From cryogenic treatments and <br>precious metal wires, to fine silk insulation and fluid <br>filled cable jackets; extreme cable designs abound.<br>  <br>Will I hear the difference?<br><br>The fact of the matter is that cables do alter the sound <br>going through them, and that it is audible. You do not need <br>to be an expert, or an audiophile, to hear the difference. <br>To demonstrate this point, simply listen to your stereo. If <br>you close your eyes, does it sound like the music is being <br>played live right in front of you? This is what audiophiles <br>strive for, and unless you have a very high-fidelity system, <br>your answer to this question will most likely be no. You may <br>have a hard time describing what exactly does not sound <br>right about your system, but you know that it doesn’t sound <br>like a live performance. <br><br>Of course, the reason why the music does not sound live <br>cannot be blamed solely on the cables. The degradation of <br>the sound occurs in every component of your system. However, <br>the point here is that even a casual listener can detect the <br>subtle distortions that can prevent music playback from <br>sounding live. Improving the quality of your audio cables <br>will improve the sound quality of your system. <br><br>It is fairly safe to say that no matter what cable you use, <br>the modifications to the sound will be small. Audio cables <br>will never cause a listener to hear a piano when a flute is <br>being played. However, it is the small detail that makes all <br>the difference between good and bad quality sound. That is <br>why very strong opinions are formed about various cables. <br> <br>As audio systems continue to improve in accuracy, listening <br>to a “live” performance in your living room gets closer to <br>reality. Cables are an enabling factor for advancements in <br>audio reproduction and can play a remarkably important role <br>in your system. <br><br>Written by: Adam Blake CEO / Co-Founder Pear Cable, Inc. <br>www.pearcable.com <br>For a more detailed explanation of cable design theory that <br>Pear Cable thinks is relevant, see the “cable design” white<br>paper available on pearcable.com

              <td align="left" height="12"><span class="style2">Building your list online can be one of the most effective ways of promoting your business online. Once you implement your plan, it will continue to send new subscribers to your list forever.<br><br>There are a few obvious things you should do to make sure that you get more subscribers. Here are three of my best tips, and three of the easiest strategies for you to implement in getting<br>subscribers to your ezine.<br><br>1. Add your subscription information to all of your pages.<br>You may find this to be obvious. However, many sites I have visited seem to think of their ezines as an afterthought. You have to dig to find out that they have one at all.<br><br>By putting your ezine subscription box on all your pages, it won't matter what page your visitors uses to arrive at your site. He/she will always have an opportunity to subscribe to your newsletter. By not having to search to find the subscription information, you are more likely to get the person to subscribe to your ezine.<br><br>It certainly doesn't hurt to have a newsletter page with a longer description of your ezine.<br><br>Write a compelling description to go with it, offer a valuable premium for subscribing, and you will get more subscribers.<br><br>2. Submit to the Ezine Directories.<br>Once you have decided what the subject of your ezine is, and you have created a format, you need to create a sample issue. This should be in HTML.<br><br>Once you have your sample issue, you need to write a title and description of your ezine and submit it to the directories. Also, you will want to put a text version of your ezine on autoresponder, as well as have a subscription page link and a subscribe email address.<br><br>Once you have all of the elements you need to submit to the directories, put all of this information in a text file so that you can copy and paste as you submit.<br><br>The easiest way to find ezine directories to submit to is to search the search engines for the term "ezine directories".<br><br>Below is a 14 page tutorial on formatting your ezine, as well as a list of ezine directories you can submit to.<br><br>http://www.nowsell.com/ezine-promotion/ezine-directory-1.html<br><br>3. Exchange Links with Other Complementary Ezines.<br>There are several things you should know so that you get the most from this technique.<br><br>First, you can contact other ezine publishers with complimentary ezines and ask them to swap ads with you. Make sure that you look at the subscriber numbers for the publishers and give the publisher a fair deal in exchange.<br><br>You can find ezines to exchange ads with by searching this ezine directory: http://www.jogena.com. I have found this to be the best directory to help you find ezines that accept ads.<br><br>You will also want to ask the publisher for a top sponsor ad so that your ezine information will be seen. If you simply exchange ads with an ezine publisher without qualifying your request, you<br>may find your ad buried deep within the ezine, reducing your chances of being seen and getting new subscribers.<br><br>There are plenty of ways to promote your ezine. What's important is that you create a plan and stick to it. Get your ezine listed in as many directories as possible, exchange ads with other ezines, and always keep marketing. You'll have a large list of new subscribers before you know it.

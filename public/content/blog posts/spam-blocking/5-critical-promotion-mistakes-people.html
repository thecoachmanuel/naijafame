              <td align="left" height="12"><span class="style2">(c) Jim Edwards - All Rights reserved<br>    http://www.thenetreporter.com<br>=====================================<br><br>Did you realize that writing and publishing articles online<br>represents one of the best-kept website traffic secrets? <br><br>It's true! In fact, if you learn some basic principles, you<br>can drive thousands of visitors to your website without<br>spending any money on advertising. Publishing articles not<br>only establishes you as an expert in your chosen field, but<br>also allows you to fly under the natural "radar defenses"<br>your prospects have against advertising.<br><br>But, beware! My experience as a syndicated newspaper<br>columnist has shown me that people who would otherwise<br>succeed massively promoting with articles actually fail<br>because they consistently make one or more of these five<br>critical mistakes! <br><br>Mistake #1 - NOT Defining Your Target Audience<br><br>Many article authors make the serious mistake of not<br>clearly defining a niche audience before writing their<br>article. Successful article authors always know the exact<br>"niche" audience they want to reach before they write the<br>first word.<br><br>When targeting your audience, remember this rule: Narrow<br>and Deep! Always pick an audience with a specific,<br>pressing, or major interest in a narrow topic!<br><br>Mistake #2 - Spamming Ezine Editors<br><br>In their desire to cover as much ground as possible, many<br>article authors resort to spam techniques for submitting<br>their articles. Instead of tightly targeting appropriate<br>ezines that cater specifically to their audience, these<br>authors try to hit "everyone." <br><br>By trying to save time, they actually waste every minute<br>spent writing their article because most ezine editors will<br>just delete their submissions as spam!<br><br>Mistake #3 - Milktoast Topics<br><br>You can write the best article in the world, but if your<br>headline doesn't grab a reader's eyeballs and pull them<br>into your article - you lose! <br><br>Article authors should spend at least half as much time<br>writing the headline as they spend writing their actual<br>article. <br><br>In fact, an "average" article can get superior results<br>simply from having a great headline at the beginning.<br><br>Mistake #4 - "What's In It For Me"<br><br>If they manage to make it past the first 3 pitfalls, many<br>article authors trip on their shoelaces at this stage of<br>the process! Don't write about what you want to write<br>about, only write on topics of high interest to your target<br>audience. <br><br>In other words, give them exactly what they want and they<br>will love you. Nobody cares how much of an expert you rate<br>on a particular topic until they know you can deliver<br>information they need in a way they can use - now!<br><br>Mistake #5 - "No Shoe Polish"<br><br>You could write an article worthy of the front page of the<br>Wall Street Journal, but as soon as somebody spots a typo<br>or misspelling, they immediately put your article lower<br>than a Sunday sales circular. <br><br>Seriously, if you want to undermine all the good you can do<br>with a great article, send it out without proper spell-<br>checking!<br><br>No matter what product or service you sell, once you<br>understand the promotion power of free articles, you'll<br>never look at website traffic generation the same way. <br><br>But remember, if you abuse the power, spam ezine editors,<br>or blatantly pitch people instead of providing real<br>information, you might as well skip the whole process<br>altogether.<br>

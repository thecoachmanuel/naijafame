              <td align="left" height="12"><span class="style2">The Google AdSense program is like finding money in the street. <br><br>Kids in High School are making thousands of dollars a month with Adsense... Housewives, Retiree's, Mom and Pop's who've never made a dime on the Internet have created full time incomes by simply placing AdSense Ads on their web site or blog.<br><br>Then you have the "Super AdSense" earners. We have all heard of them... the Elite few who are on track to make half a million dollars a year or more promoting AdSense sites. <br><br>Do not be mistaken though... these people are not building like your Mom and Pop's do. They have systems in place that create sites for them... people who build sites for them... they have outsourced and automated many of the tedious tasks such as posting to blogs and searching for keywords. <br><br>While most people cannot emulate everything these Super AdSense earners do... many of them you can.<br><br>Here are 7 Required Steps you can implement today to copy their success. <br><br>1) Starting today... treat your AdSense business like it is a REAL business and track what you do.<br><br>Begin tracking what you are doing that works... as well as what you are doing that does not work. This will keep you from making the same mistakes over and over, and you can repeat the steps that have worked in the past. As simple as this step seems... most people do not know the reason(s) to their success or failure. <br><br>2) Utilize the latest tools and software available.<br><br>The Super AdSense earners are not any smarter than your average person. I know many people think they are... but for the most part, they are regular non techie people. <br><br>They are smarter in one respect though... they use the latest tools available to them to automate most of the tasks involved with researching and creating sites. They use the latest keyword, site creation and search engine optimization tools available. The tools they use are their secret weapons.<br><br>3) Quit chasing the Mega Dollar keywords.<br><br>You cannot compete with the search engine experts who create sites for the $80 payout keywords. You may get lucky every now and then... but in the long run, you are better off building sites for the low to mid range payout keywords. The competition is less, and your chance of success is much higher over the long term.<br><br>4) Choose broad niches and break it down.<br><br>Choose a broad subject as your main theme (lets use computers for an example). From there... break it down into as many sub niches as possible. <br><br>Using Computers as the example... you could build sub niches/sites like laptop computers, computer hard drives, computer keyboards, etc, etc. You could literally build hundreds of sites around one major theme and stay totally focused. Once you have exhausted every possible sub niche of that major theme... choose another main theme and repeat the process.<br><br>5) KISS<br><br>Keep your sites easy to navigate and forget the fancy graphics that distract your visitors attention. Unless you are just building AdSense sites for the fun of it and to impress your friends... the purpose of having the site is to have people click on one of the ads, right? Then keep the site layout simple... dump the scrolling banners, dancing chickens and colored scroll bars... they are distractions.<br><br>6) What is the purpose of your web site?<br><br>Your web site cannot be everything to everybody. If you have a full fledged ecommerce site, with products for sale... links to other products, it is not a good site for AdSense. If the primary focus of the site is to sell products... let it do that. <br><br>Do not distract or confuse your visitor with to many options or choices. The best AdSense sites are AdSense only content sites that sell nothing. They are sites that "Tell"... not "Sell."<br><br>7) Be consistent.<br><br>This is not one of those deals where you build one site and you are done. Refer back to Step #4. You must continuously build in order to be successful. <br><br>Think of it as planting a crop that you will harvest in a month or two, and the sites you build are seeds. Once the seeds have grown and matured... you will reap the harvest. The more seeds you plant... the larger the harvest.<br><br>To sum it up... utilize the tools available to automate as much of the process of building sites - doing research and building keyword lists as you can. This alone will help keep you organized and on track. Be consistent in building... treat it like the business it is and you will reap the rewards of your harvest.

              <td align="left"><span class="style2"> <br>The phenomenal growth of ecommerce lures more and more people <br>to dream about starting an online business. The question that <br>bothers many and restrains them from realizing their dream is <br>what to sell on the Internet. <br>If you have spent sometime on the Internet trying to figure <br>out what product or service you should choose to sell online, <br>you must have noticed that people are selling every conceivable<br>product and service over the Internet. Contrary to popular <br>belief, even big ticket items are also selling on the Internet <br>very well. But, nevertheless, it is not very easy for a newbie <br>to find a product rather quickly and start marketing online.<br><br>If you are having difficulty in finding a good tangible product <br>to market on the Internet or afraid to manage all the hassles <br>of shipping and handling you may seriously consider selling <br>information online.<br><br>According to data, most people browse through the Internet in <br>search of some sorts of information that they require. Survey <br>conducted by Neilsen Media Research shows that Books and <br>Information Category tops the highest selling product and <br>service on the Internet with a significant margin in comparison <br>to other categories. This makes information a natural product<br>for sale on the Internet.

You will be truly amazed by the scope of ideas! <br><br>Although, information is the most sought after product on the <br>Internet; that does not mean it is an easy-to-sell product. For <br>one thing – there are tons of free information available on the <br>Internet, and the second is people on the Internet are not very <br>willing to pay for information. This is the reason why you have <br>to be very careful in choosing the right product to market online.<br><br>People will buy your information product, if it is:<br><br>- A particular knowledge that they crave<br>- It makes their life easier, i.e. saves time<br>- It teaches them some subject that they would like to learn.<br><br>Which are the products that fall in these categories?<br><br>Expert advises, tips and ideas in a niche field: <br><br>Body building tips, dieting secrets, dating ideas, stock trading <br>secrets, Internet marketing ideas are examples of this category. <br><br>Trend forecasts: <br><br>Businesses spend fortunes to have a better understanding of <br>specific trends. If you have enough expertise to predict a trend <br>of a specific field, i.e. high technology, stock market, Internet, <br>etc., you may have a comfortable living by selling newsletter <br>and whitepapers. The hard part is: you have to prove that you are <br>really an expert in this field. <br><br>Courses: <br><br>Thanks to Internet, more and more people are willing to learn <br>different subjects from the comfort of their work and home. If <br>you have enough knowledge of a particular subject, create an <br>online course and market it through Internet.<br><br>Surveys and data: <br><br>Business bases on various marketing, demographic, sales and <br>other data. You may collect those data from various sources <br>and by conducting your own online surveys. This also requires <br>enough knowledge of a specific business field and their <br>requirement.<br><br>Research and Analysis: <br><br>People are often ready to pay for research and analysis <br>information of their fields because, in general, this saves their <br>own time. That is why subscription based stocks and other research <br>websites are thriving on the Internet.<br><br>There are number of other reasons why you should consider <br>selling information on the Internet.<br><br>Audience size <br><br>Millions of people from all over the world are browsing through <br>the Internet in any given time. Your information product can be <br>exposed to a very large number of prospective buyers in no time.<br><br>Easy to develop <br><br>Information products like reports and e-books are fairly easy <br>to create. All you need is – the knowledge of the field, a <br>little determination and enough time to spend on it.<br><br>Low cost and low over head <br><br>You can create and market a report for less than US $100. You <br>can take advantage of numbers of free marketing tools available <br>on the Internet. You can even keep your overhead low by doing <br>things all by yourself.<br><br>You can start part time <br><br>This is one business you can start from shoestring and spending <br>only couple of hours a day. You can keep your job until you <br>feel comfortable with the earning you generate through your online <br>endeavor.<br><br>Conduct business from anywhere <br><br>The best thing about this business is you can do it from <br>anywhere. You are no longer confined to a specific geographical <br>region. While developing your information product keep in mind <br>the following aspects:<br><br>- Does this product satisfy a need or does it solve a problem?<br>- Is their enough value in it?<br>- Is it a better product than others available on the Internet?<br>- Is this product easy to market to your chosen market segment?<br><br>The last question is very important as the sheer size of <br>Internet makes it virtually impossible to focus on it as a whole. <br>You must segment your market as clearly and as specifically as <br>possible to become a successful Internet marketer.<br><br>Once you finished developing your product, initially, try <br>selling your product through a marketplace similar to Clickbank.<br>This will allow you to setup your online business fairly quick. <br>You will not need a merchant account of your own and you can <br>build your affiliate program with an ease.<br><br><p> About the Author

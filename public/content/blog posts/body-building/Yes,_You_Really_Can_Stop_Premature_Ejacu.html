              <td align="left"><span class="style2">Until recently, guys with premature ejaculation problems had to wait at least a few weeks to see results from natural solutions. However, new research has finally revealed why some guys last and others simply can’t. Based on the training principles of body building, it is now possible to teach your body how to have sex correctly through a serious of specially designed exercises.<br><br>So what is premature ejaculation, and how long is really enough?<br><br>Well premature ejaculation, or PE, is commonly defined as the inability to delay ejaculation to a point where both partners are satisfied; and this can be anywhere from 10 seconds to 10 minutes. It all depends on what you and your partner define as "too fast". Research shows that the average man will ejaculate within 1-3 minutes of penetration, while the average woman will orgasm after 12-15 minutes! With such a large gap it is no surprise that more than 30% of guys suffer from the anxiety of premature ejaculation!<br><br>So how do you stop it I hear you ask?<br><br>Fortunately, the ability to last a long time is a learned behaviour. Almost every man over fifty will tell you that he can delay ejaculation much longer today than when he was younger. Sexually inexperienced men have not yet learned to recognize the feeling of being about to come inside a woman. Recognizing and dealing with that feeling comes with experience. However, don’t be fooled into thinking that just having more sex will cure this kind of inexperience – it won’t! It’s not the amount of sex you’ve had – it’s the amount of learning and training. Learning to control the penis and taking charge of your own ejaculation are the keys to success.<br><br>Using traditional methods such as the "Squeeze Method", the "Masters and Johnson Method" and the "Stop Start Method" usually takes a few weeks to see results. These methods are designed for you and your partner to simply get used to sex and that is often the biggest part of early ejaculation problems anyway. Fixing Premature Ejaculation with the help of your partner only makes it even more embarrassing and awkward for you and it’s no wonder these techniques take so long to see results! <br><br>Doctors will sometimes prescribe medications that have ejaculatory retardation as a side effect. Even if those medications work (they don’t always), this doesn’t cure anything. You can’t stay on the drugs for a lifetime, and in relying on the external aid, you’ll never learn to control your orgasm for yourself. Also, most of these sprays and drugs simply numb the penis so you don’t feel the excitement. What’s the point of sex if you can’t enjoy it? <br><br>If we change our approach to having longer sex by focusing on the actual love making muscles rather than just waiting to get used to coming slower, then results can be seen inside of a week. In the sporting world, different training methods are used to build the two types of muscle fibres know as “fast twitch” and “slow twitch”. Generally weight lifters have denser slow twitch fibres for more power, and sprinters have denser fast twitch fibres for speed. If we apply their training methods to the muscles of sex, then we are able to develop total control much faster.<br><br>Gaining control during sex is as simple as taking control over your breathing, and control over the PC muscle. The PC muscle is located between the scrotum and the anus, and contracts both quickly and slowly during sex. By training it correctly, premature ejaculation can be controlled far quicker than by simply waiting for it to happen with traditional methods. <br><br>Also, anxiety is also a major contributor to fast ejaculation, and as a result your body tenses up and can’t perform correctly. By learning correct breathing techniques you can relax your body, and coupled with the confidence of controlling your PC muscle, you can be well on your way to stopping this embarrassing problem for ever!<br><br>Outlining a full program to cure PE would take more than this article allows, however a basic program involves holding your PC for 10 seconds, then relaxing for a few seconds and repeating this cycle for 10 repetitions. You can also do short fast holds, for 20 reps each time. This will let you to begin to gain control over your PC muscle, and over time your PC worries will become a thing of the past!<br><br>Believe me, everyone is capable of lasting as long as they want to, and it has nothing to do with you thinking that you are in some way different to all the other "normal" guys. You simply need to build new habits for sex and to understand how to control the correct muscles to last as long as you should be!<br><br>Alex Sharp<br>CEO, Natural-Stamina.com<br>www.Natural-Stamina.com<br><p> About the Author
